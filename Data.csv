I am stuck between bills and my son, and it’s a hard choice. Really hard,” said Felix Franco, 30, a U.S. Postal Service employee who has been on leave recovering from COVID-19 himself since spring and was planning to return to work in two weeks.Franco, who said he had no one else lined up to care for his 6-year-old son during the school day, is already behind on his monthly car bill and racking up credit card debt.Slideshow ( 5 images )New York City has seen a late-autumn resurgence of the virus after a summertime lull. Schools have been following a staggered, part-time system of classroom instruction since September, with 1.1 million students dividing their school week between in-person and online learning.But de Blasio said all instruction would switch back to distance learning again because the positive rate on coronavirus tests in the city rose to a seven-day average of 3%, the threshold for ceasing in-person classes.“We must fight back the second wave of COVID-19,” he said.New York joins other large school districts in cities like Boston and Detroit that have recently canceled in-person learning. Within the past week, the Clark County School District, which includes Las Vegas and is the fifth largest in the United States, and Philadelphia’s public school system both postponed plans to return to in-person instruction.HOSPITALIZATIONS SURGINGAs of Wednesday, COVID-19 had claimed at least 250,016 lives in the United States, which has documented about 11.5 million infections since the pandemic emerged, according to a Reuters tally of public healthcare data. The United States leads the world in both categories.More than 1,400 of those victims perished during the past 24 hours.Nearly 79,000 COVID-19 patients were reported in U.S. hospitals as of Wednesday, the highest number yet for a single day, up from about 75,000 on Tuesday, Reuters’ tally showed.Slideshow ( 5 images )Health experts say greater social mixing and indoor gatherings during the holiday season, combined with colder weather, could accelerate the surge, threatening to overwhelm already strained healthcare systems.NBC News reported on Wednesday that more than 900 Mayo Clinic personnel in Minnesota and Wisconsin had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past two weeks - nearly a third of the cases among the medical center’s Midwestern staff since March.The Midwest has become the new U.S. epicenter of contagion, reporting almost a half-million cases during the week ending on Monday.Ohio’s Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, ordered residents on Wednesday to stay at home “to the greatest extent possible” through Dec. 17 in response to “an unprecedented recent surge of severely ill patients requiring hospitalization.”Government officials in at least 21 states, representing both sides of the U.S. political divide, have issued sweeping new public health mandates this month. Those range from stricter limits on social gatherings and non-essential businesses to new requirements for wearing masks in public places.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday called the wave of new restrictions an overreach by state and local officials.“The American people know how to protect their health,” she told Fox News in an interview. “We don’t lose our freedom in this country. We make responsible health decisions as individuals.”Public health experts were less sanguine.“I’m the most concerned I’ve been since this pandemic started,” Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CNN on Wednesday.Forty-one U.S. states have reported daily record increases in COVID-19 cases in November, 20 have registered all-time highs in coronavirus-related deaths from day to day and 26 have reported peaks in hospitalizations, according to the Reuters tally.In Washington, pressure for a fresh COVID-19 economic relief bill mounted in Congress. Senate Democrats also unveiled legislation to ramp up the national supply of personal protective equipment for healthcare and other frontline workers.Reporting by Gabriella Borter and Brendan O’Brien in New York; Additional reporting by Anurag Maan, Susan Heavey and Maria Caspani; Writing by Gabriella Borter and Steve Gorman; Editing by Bill Tarrant, Cynthia Osterman and Peter CooneyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

That is a condition of releasing funds and resources to the winner, but she has so far not done so.Despite a clear margin of victory for Biden, Trump has refused to concede, and his legal challenges are fizzling.Murphy has sole authority to release salaries, office space, official email addresses and intelligence briefings to an incoming administration, which formally takes over with Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.“Unless it’s made available soon, we’re going to be behind by weeks or months,” in his administration’s coronavirus effort, Biden told emergency responders, nurses and other frontline workers at an online event in Washington. “So, I just want to tell you that that’s the only slowdown right now that we have.”A third wave of coronavirus infection has gripped the United States, and the country’s death toll crossed 250,000 people on Wednesday.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Wednesday described a “crazy situation” where he speaks daily with the White House coronavirus experts and has a separate channel of communications with Biden’s advisory board on the virus.“Those two camps aren’t speaking. And that’s a big problem,” Murphy, a Democrat, told CNN. “That is a major problem that could put both the distribution of the vaccine at risk and, more broadly, lives at risk.”FILE PHOTO: U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney swears in U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Emily W. Murphy in Washington, U.S. December 5, 2017. Picture taken December 5, 2017.  GSA/Handout via REUTERS. The GSA’s Murphy is under mounting pressure from election watchdogs, Democrats, a growing number of Republicans, the American Medical Association and her predecessor to recognize Biden as the winner.“She’s going to make an ascertainment when the winner is clear, as laid out in the Constitution,” a GSA spokeswoman said before Biden’s remarks.Late on Wednesday, the leaders of the National Association of Manufacturers, including Dow Chemical CEO Jim Fitterling, called on Murphy to sign the needed papers “to ensure manufacturers can continue to work seamlessly with the federal government” on challenges such as vaccine distribution.“There is no time to waste nor room for error,” they wrote in a joint letter. “We know what is at stake: American lives and livelihoods.”The bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises said on Tuesday it was “past time” for the GSA administrator to certify Biden: “This isn’t about politics. It’s about honoring free and fair elections. It’s also about lost lives.”Trump claims, without providing evidence, that the election was marred by widespread fraud and has fired off a flurry of lawsuits that judges have mostly rejected.An administration official said the White House was not pressuring Murphy to withhold recognition of Biden as the winner.2000 vs. 2020Murphy is relying on precedent, her office said, citing the five-week delay after the 2000 election before Republican George W. Bush was declared the winner over Democrat Al Gore.While the 2000 result hung on 537 votes in just one state - Florida - Trump would need to reverse Biden’s large margins in three of four closely contested states, something election experts say is virtually impossible.The GSA did not say how or when Murphy would make her decision, and the agency has not responded to a congressional letter asking the same questions, a House of Representatives Subcommittee on Government Operations official said.Trump administration sources said it was reasonable to wait until vote recounts are completed and the legal challenges have been resolved - a process that is continuing.On Wednesday, the Trump campaign requested a partial recount in Wisconsin in two heavily Democratic counties.Dave Barram, who was GSA administrator in 2000, said Murphy contacted him shortly before the election to discuss how he handled that year’s contested scenario.“In 2000, there was no clear winner, and both Gore and Bush knew it. This is different. It’s getting overwhelmingly evident that Trump should concede,” Barram said.Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by David Shepardson and Jason Lange; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Peter CooneyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Genetic (nucleic acid) tests are more accurate than antigen tests. These are used for making a diagnosis of current #COVID-19 infection.”— Raed Dweik, MD, MBA, chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Respiratory InstituteCan people safely rely on test results to socialize?“You should not rely on test results alone to safely socialize in person. A test can only tell you if you are positive at a given moment in time, and can also fail to detect cases if you are infected but not yet shedding substantial virus.”— Dr. Angela Rasmussen, virologist affiliated with Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security“Now is the time for delayed gratification. My family pushed back Thanksgiving to the spring and look forward to a safer event at that time.”— Dr. Joshua Schiffer, associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research CenterIf someone thinks they have been exposed to COVID-19, should they get tested?“If you think you’ve been exposed to COVID-19, first protect others by limiting your contact with anyone else as best as you can. Get tested even if you don’t have symptoms. And quarantine until you get the results.”— Heather Pierce, JD, MPH, senior director and regulatory counsel at Association of American Medical Colleges“Yes! If you think you’ve been exposed, get tested. Whether or not you have symptoms or are at increased risk, you should get tested if your local testing capacity allows it.”— Dr. Syra Madad, senior director, Special Pathogens at New York City Health & HospitalsWhat are the current successes and failures of testing?“Despite many bumps in the road, a massive success is the number of tests currently available. It’s remarkable that so many have achieved FDA authorization. We continue, however, to struggle to meet testing demand, which requires more reagents and more people.”— Infectious Diseases Society of America“To me, the biggest failure is that we are still unable to do what South Korea and Taiwan were able to do in the spring. The failure of testing continues to plague us. Long lines, long turnaround time, lack of reagents.”— Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health SecurityHow can testing be democratized so that everyone has access?“We need to hardwire equity into our COVID-19 response in terms of access, prioritization and coverage. Essential workers are not prioritized in COVID-19 testing, yet they have the highest exposure.”— Roopa Dhatt, executive director at Women in Global Health“Globally, the lack of widespread availability of testing is partly what is resulting in an underestimate of the true burden of this pandemic. A lot more people have had and have died of this disease than have been diagnosed.”— Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, infectious-diseases physician and associate professor at the Boston University School of MedicineCan mass testing be used for people to return to “normal”?“No. Testing does not replace basic prevention measures such as social distancing and wearing masks. Testing negative only means you have no detectable virus at the time of the test.”— Joe Eisenberg, chair and professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health“Regardless of testing, we must not abandon at this point the pillars of public health: use of masks, physical distance and frequent hand washing.”— Dr. Diego Hijano, instructor in the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research HospitalWhat gives you hope?“I have hope that soon we will have more tools to help us fight the pandemic in the vaccines. However people need to understand they will not magically solve the pandemic but are tools to add to the public health interventions we already have and we need to use them all.”— Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, infectious disease researcher“For the first time, I have hope. Interim vaccine data show more than 90% efficacy, as much as measles. By next winter, we will be getting back to normal. By 2022, we will start to socialize.

Several prominent law firms have pulled out of the operation, leaving Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to spearhead the efforts.State and federal election officials, as well as outside experts, say Trump’s argument the election was stolen from him by widespread voter fraud has no basis in fact.However, it does appear to be affecting public confidence in American democracy. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday found about half of Republicans believe Trump “rightfully won” the election.Arizona’s top election official, Katie Hobbs, said she and her family had been getting violent threats. Hobbs, a Democrat, called on Trump to stop casting doubt on the result.Trump himself has no public events scheduled for Thursday. He has largely stayed in the White House and kept out of public view since the election.His administration so far has refused to recognise Biden as the winner, which has held up funding and security clearances to ease the transition from one president to another ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration.Biden said on Wednesday the delay is preventing his team from being able to plan new efforts to fight a third wave of coronavirus infections, which is putting immense strain on the U.S. healthcare system.Writing by Andy Sullivan, editing by Ross Colvin and Lincoln Feast.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Ananthalakshmi4 Min ReadKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders called on Thursday for open and multilateral trade to support a global economy battered by the novel coronavirus, and some hoped for more engagement with the United States under a Joe Biden administration.China's President Xi Jinping speaks during a CEO Dialogue forum via video link, ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit, hosted by APEC Malaysia, November 19, 2020. APEC CEO DIALOGUES MALAYSIA 2020/via REUTERS TVChinese President Xi Jinping, among the leaders at a virtual meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, rejected protectionism and said globalisation was “irreversible”, a day before U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to join in the gathering.“We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by ‘decoupling’ or forming a small circle to keep others out,” Xi said at a forum ahead of the APEC leaders meeting to be held virtually in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.“China will remain committed to openness and cooperation, and adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits,” he said.Xi said “mounting unilateralism, protectionism and bullying as well as backlash against economic globalisation” had added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy.Trump has introduced protectionist trade policies since coming to power in 2017, including tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products that launched a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.The APEC leaders’ meeting comes as economies are trying to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and days after Trump lost his bid for a second term.Trump, who has yet to concede and begin a transfer of government to President-elect Biden, was due to represent the United States at the virtual summit on Friday, a U.S. official said. It will be the first time he has joined an APEC summit since 2017, the only time he has participated.Biden has signalled a return to multilateralism pursued during Barack Obama’s presidency, though questions remain over whether the new president would reverse Trump-era policies.Slideshow ( 4 images )‘MORE SUPPORTIVE’Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the APEC forum he expected “more multilateralists” in the Biden administration.“I think that they will be more supportive of the WTO, and of APEC. I am not sure that they will be more keen on throwing the doors wide open, or joining the CPTPP, because that depends on domestic politics too,” he said, referring to the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.Lee also said U.S. trade policies under Trump had weighed on APEC’s progress in recent years, which he termed “very slow”.“Also, they have not been supportive of trade as a win-win proposition. The attitude of the Trump administration is that this is a win-lose proposition,” Lee said.Trump’s “America First” approach saw the United States withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement in 2017. It has since changed its name to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).The United States is also absent from the world’s largest free-trade bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) - a 15-nation pact backed by China that was signed last week.At the last APEC meeting in 2018, the countries failed to agree on a joint communique, the first time in the bloc’s history, as the United States and China stood at opposing ends of talks on trade and investments.Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyidin Yassin said APEC countries were working on a “post 2020” vision and he stressed that free and multilateral trade was integral to economic recovery.“This is essential for our businesses as market stability and predictability are the central pillars which ensure that trade and investment continue to flow, even during times of crisis,” he said.Additional reporting by Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang in Beijing; Writing by A.

REUTERS/Mick Tsikas Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia’s General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents.All of those kills were outside the “heat of battle”, Campbell said.“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” Campbell told reporters in Canberra.“The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia’s military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.Australia’s Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.Related CoverageFactbox: Quotes from Australia's Defence Force report into Afghanistan‘BLOODING’Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include “difficult and hard news for Australians”, but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.“There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier’s first kill, in a practice that was known as ‘blooding’,” the report read.Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy andcompartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols.The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia’s official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016.The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims’ families even without a successful prosecution.Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani’s office wrote on Twitter.Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Stephen Coates and Michael PerryOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

But many are now wary of seeming to toe the FAA line after the U.S. agency was faulted for lax oversight.“It’s too soon,” agreed Anton Sahadi, who had two young relatives on board the doomed flight. “It wasn’t just the Lion Air flight, but also the victims in Ethiopia... The victims’ families haven’t 100% recovered yet.”Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt “sheer disappointment and renewed grief” after the FAA’s decision to return the aircraft to service.“Our family was broken,” Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said.In Indonesia, some of the aggrieved relatives said clearance had been granted faster than compensation.“Why has the flight permit been granted while the affairs of the victims’ family have not been fully resolved?” asked Latief Nurbana, a civil servant who lost his 24-year-old son.He said compensation payments and arrangements with the Boeing Community Investment Fund (BCIF) were still unsettled.The BCIF’s website said that the distribution of funds to provide philanthropic support to communities affected by the crashes would be completed by Jan. 15, 2021.A Boeing spokeswoman and spokesman for Lion Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In both accidents a stall-prevention system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully shoved down the jet’s nose as the pilots struggled to regain control.Adita Irawati, an Indonesian transportation ministry spokeswoman, said Indonesia would allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly once the FAA issued airworthiness directives.On-the-ground and simulator training for pilots would be included in that process, and the timing would be dependent on compliance with the requirements, Irawati said.Grieving relative Sahadi said profit should not guide an urgency to get back in the air.“This means they don’t prioritize safety, considering there have been fatal mistakes that led to these two airlines having terrible accidents,” Sahadi said.Additional reporting by Heru Asprihanto; Writing by Kate Lamb; Editing by Ed Davies and Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The victims’ families haven’t 100% recovered yet.”Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt “sheer disappointment and renewed grief” after the FAA’s decision to return the aircraft to service.“Our family was broken,” Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said.In Indonesia, some of the aggrieved relatives said clearance had been granted faster than compensation.“Why has the flight permit been granted while the affairs of the victims’ family have not been fully resolved?” asked Latief Nurbana, a civil servant who lost his 24-year-old son.He said compensation payments and arrangements with the Boeing Community Investment Fund (BCIF) were still unsettled.The BCIF’s website said that the distribution of funds to provide philanthropic support to communities affected by the crashes would be completed by Jan. 15, 2021.A Boeing spokeswoman and spokesman for Lion Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In both accidents a stall-prevention system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully shoved down the jet’s nose as the pilots struggled to regain control.Adita Irawati, an Indonesian transportation ministry spokeswoman, said Indonesia would allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly once the FAA issued airworthiness directives.On-the-ground and simulator training for pilots would be included in that process, and the timing would be dependent on compliance with the requirements, Irawati said.Grieving relative Sahadi said profit should not guide an urgency to get back in the air.“This means they don’t prioritize safety, considering there have been fatal mistakes that led to these two airlines having terrible accidents,” Sahadi said.Additional reporting by Heru Asprihanto; Writing by Kate Lamb; Editing by Ed Davies and Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS/File PhotoPrime Minister Boris Johnson wants to carve out a leading role for Britain in a new era of global cooperation and free trade, backed by modern military and cyber capabilities.Johnson said the increased spending reflected the need to upgrade military capabilities, including pioneering new technology with plans for a new space command and artificial intelligence agency.In a speech to parliament on Thursday outlining the first conclusions from the biggest review of foreign policy and defence in three decades, Johnson will announce an extra 16.5 billion pounds for the military over the next four years. The defence budget is currently just under 42 billion pounds a year.“I have taken this decision in the teeth of the pandemic because the defence of the realm must come first,” Johnson said in a statement.“The international situation is more perilous and more intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War and Britain must be true to our history and stand alongside our allies. To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board.”At a time of heightened global uncertainty, the continued rise of China and after four years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s international diplomacy, Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union has thrown its own role and global influence into doubt.The new financial deal comes just a week after Johnson promised U.S. President-elect Joe Biden that Britain was determined to remain a valuable military ally.The government said the increased military spending will cement the United Kingdom’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe, the second largest in NATO, and allow increased investment in areas such as cyber and space.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain was not growing its military budget at the expense of international aid, amid media reports that billions of pounds could be cut from the foreign aid budget“It doesn’t mean to say we are abandoning the battlefield of international aid, we’re still one of the most generous givers of international aid,” Wallace told Sky News.The full conclusions of the defence and security review - a study of threats and capabilities - will be announced next year.Editing by Stephen Addison and Toby ChopraOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Kiyoshi Ota/Pool via REUTERSTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) kicked off debates on Thursday on tax incentives next fiscal year to help Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga push his agenda on digitalisation and zero carbon emission backed by private-sector investment.The incentives are expected to help pivot the world’s third- largest economy away from heavy government stimulus and back to private sector-led sustainable growth, after suffering the record postwar slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April-June.“We must discuss how to establish tax system that responds to the premier’s calls for digitalisation and green society, which are pillars of a new era of with-corona and post-corona,” the LDP tax commission head Akira Amari told its gathering.Amari, a former economy minister who is close to the premier, steers debates at the tax panel, which will compile next month annual tax-code revision for the next fiscal year from April.The premier has set digitalisation and environmental policy as planks of his growth strategy, with the aim of accelerating innovation and investment in renewable energy and digital transformation.The tax commission also is seen considering extending tax breaks on low-emission vehicles as well as home mortgages to stimulate private consumption which has been hit hard by the health crisis.The tax breaks are expected to target next-generation lithium-ion batteries used for electric vehicles as lower costs of batteries could help electric vehicles replace gasoline cars, domestic media reported.Suga unveiled a plan last month to cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and become a carbon-neutral society, in an ambitious shift from Japan’s previous stance of aiming for carbon neutral in the second half of the century.He hopes digital transformation will streamline business and government processes and revive flagging growth.Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Amit Dave/FilesShares in the firm, controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani, have soared three-fold since the signing of the 8 gigawatt (GW) multi-plant deal, which Adani hailed as the “largest of its type, ever” and a landmark for India.However, previously unreported details of the agreement between Adani Green and Solar Energy Corp of India Ltd (SECI) reveal the agency has no “legal or financial obligation” to support the project if SECI fails to find buyers.This would be the first major SECI project without a state-guaranteed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which analysts say has been key to building up India’s renewable energy sector.When SECI floated the tender for the project in June 2019, it had said a PPA would be assured, but it withdrew the clause guaranteeing purchase in the deal signed a year later.“There shall not be any legal or financial implication to SECI in relation to such (unsold) quantum including associated quantum of manufacturing facilities,” the agreement, reviewed by Reuters, says.FINANCING RISKAdani Green has said 2 GW of generation capacity will come onstream by 2022, while the rest will be added in annual 2GW increments through 2025 as a part of the agreement.There are no buyers lined up for the project yet and it is unclear when SECI will be able to find buyers, a process that typically takes months.Auctions by the SECI usually attract greater participation because of the assurance of power purchase and payments.But the lack of such a guarantee could undermine investor and lender confidence, raising financing costs in a market like India where power demand growth has repeatedly fallen short of expectations amid a broader economic slowdown.The quality of “federal government-guaranteed contracts with cashflow payment certainty provide investors the confidence to deploy tens of billions of dollars”, said Tim Buckley, director at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Adani Green has said it would receive interim funding for the project from a consortium of foreign banks, and later with money raised from the capital markets.It has reassured investors of its ability to tap markets citing its sovereign grade rating.It declined to comment on the project on Thursday.“We have full visibility and we would be in a position to inform the market shortly,” the group’s chief financial officer, Jugeshinder Singh, said earlier this month.Adani Green aims to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2030. It has an installed renewable energy capacity of 2.8 GW and wants to increase that to 25 GW by 2025.‘ENOUGH MARGIN AVAILABLE’Gautam Adani has said the latest project can make a profit at the power price of 2.92 rupees ($0.0393) per kilowatt hour (kwh) agreed in the SECI tender. “At 2.92 rupees, there is enough margin available plus we also have time of 3-5 years to implement this project,” he said in June.The SECI tender for the project had dragged on for a year with the agency extending deadlines and raising the maximum bidding price to 2.93 rupees/kwh from 2.75 rupees/kwh.“SECI thought the final price agreed was on the higher side, and that’s why there was no purchase assurance,” an official familiar with the deal said on condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter.Since dropping the PPA with Adani, SECI has removed the clause from some other renewable energy tenders too.SECI Managing Director J.N. Swain told Reuters on Wednesday potential buyers of power were consulted and “due processes” were followed during the auction and before signing the agreement with Adani.Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan in CHENNAI and Neha Dasgupta in NEW DELHI; Editing by Nidhi Verma and Himani SarkarOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It is the highest profile visit by a Pakistani official to Kabul since peace talks began between the Taliban and the Afghan government in the Qatari capital of Doha.And it comes days after the Pentagon announced it would reduce the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January.Due to leave office on Jan. 20 after losing this month’s presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump is seeking to end the 19-year war in Afghanistan, the United States’ longest conflict.Critics slammed Trump for timing the withdrawal to his own calendar as opposed to some kind of breakthrough in Afghanistan that would justify a major drawdown.And outside of Afghanistan, nowhere is the risk of instability greater than in neighbouring Pakistan.Mistrust has cloaked relations between the neighbours, due to Pakistan’s covert support for the Taliban during the past two decades. And as militants later began launching attacks inside Pakistan, it accused Afghanistan of stirring trouble in its borders.“Focus would be on further deepening the fraternal bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Afghan peace process, and regional economic development and connectivity,” Pakistan’s foreign office said in a statement as Khan headed for Kabul.Pakistan’s role in the peace talks has been key, according to Washington, particularly given its influence over the Taliban leadership, though Pakistan says that influence has waned over the years.Washington’s special representative for Afghan peace, Zalmay Khalilzad has a made a number of trips to Islamabad to discuss the peace process.Ghani had last visited Pakistan in June 2019, according to Pakistan’s foreign office.A spokesman for the Afghan presidential palace, Dawa Khan Minapal, said the main purpose of the visit would be bilateral trade and economic relations, but the fight against militancy in the region would also be at the top of the agenda.“The focus will be mainly on the peace process but we won’t keep our hopes high,” said a source in the Afghan presidential palace.Violence has remained high in Afghanistan despite the ongoing peace process.During the past six months the Taliban have carried out 53 suicide attacks, while 1,210 civilians were among the thousands killed in violence linked to the insurgency, according to Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry.Reporting by Adbul Qadir Sediqi and Orooj Hakimi in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield in Islamabad; Additional reporting by Hamid Shalizi; Writing by Gibran Peshimam; Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

APEC CEO DIALOGUES MALAYSIA 2020/via REUTERS TVChinese President Xi Jinping, among the leaders at a virtual meeting of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, rejected protectionism and said globalisation was “irreversible”, a day before U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to join in the gathering.“We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by ‘decoupling’ or forming a small circle to keep others out,” Xi said at a forum ahead of the APEC leaders meeting to be held virtually in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.“China will remain committed to openness and cooperation, and adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits,” he said.Xi said “mounting unilateralism, protectionism and bullying as well as backlash against economic globalisation” had added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy.Trump has introduced protectionist trade policies since coming to power in 2017, including tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products that launched a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.The APEC leaders’ meeting comes as economies are trying to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and days after Trump lost his bid for a second term.Trump, who has yet to concede and begin a transfer of government to President-elect Biden, was due to represent the United States at the virtual summit on Friday, a U.S. official said. It will be the first time he has joined an APEC summit since 2017, the only time he has participated.Biden has signalled a return to multilateralism pursued during Barack Obama’s presidency, though questions remain over whether the new president would reverse Trump-era policies.Slideshow ( 4 images )‘MORE SUPPORTIVE’Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told the APEC forum he expected “more multilateralists” in the Biden administration.“I think that they will be more supportive of the WTO, and of APEC. I am not sure that they will be more keen on throwing the doors wide open, or joining the CPTPP, because that depends on domestic politics too,” he said, referring to the successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.Lee also said U.S. trade policies under Trump had weighed on APEC’s progress in recent years, which he termed “very slow”.“Also, they have not been supportive of trade as a win-win proposition. The attitude of the Trump administration is that this is a win-lose proposition,” Lee said.Trump’s “America First” approach saw the United States withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement in 2017. It has since changed its name to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).The United States is also absent from the world’s largest free-trade bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) - a 15-nation pact backed by China that was signed last week.At the last APEC meeting in 2018, the countries failed to agree on a joint communique, the first time in the bloc’s history, as the United States and China stood at opposing ends of talks on trade and investments.Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyidin Yassin said APEC countries were working on a “post 2020” vision and he stressed that free and multilateral trade was integral to economic recovery.“This is essential for our businesses as market stability and predictability are the central pillars which ensure that trade and investment continue to flow, even during times of crisis,” he said.Additional reporting by Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang in Beijing; Writing by A.

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuHong Kong’s Journalist Association had launched a judicial review in 2019 following widespread anti-government protests, arguing that the government had an obligation to set up a mechanism capable of “effective investigation” into suspected ill treatment by the police.An independent enquiry into police handling of the protests in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city became a main demand of the protesters last year, along with universal suffrage.The former British colony’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has said the existing mechanism was sufficient to deal with complaints and there was no need to set up an independent system.The court disagreed and stated that the government was under a “duty pursuant” to Article 3 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, to establish and maintain an independent mechanism.“The existing complaints mechanism involving the complaints against the police office, with oversight by the Independent Police Complaints Council, is inadequate to discharge this obligation,” the court said in its judgement.Hong Kong’s Bill of Rights was introduced in 1991 as the then British-ruled city was preparing for its 1997 handover to China under a “one country, two systems” formula aimed at guaranteeing it a high degree of autonomy.The court ruling comes amid fears in the city over the erosion of its judicial independence by Beijing.A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday that authorities were working on reforms related to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, including its judicial system.The independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary is seen as crucial to its role as an international financial hub and an interface between mainland China’s closed capital system and the rest of the world.The court also ruled that police officers not prominently displaying their identification numbers also violated the Bill of Rights.Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The TPLF and Ethiopian authorities should take urgent steps to end the conflict, enable humanitarian access, and protect civilians,” he tweeted.The Ethiopian government statement came a day after arrest warrants were issued for 76 military officials that the government said were affiliated with the Tigray leadership.Ethiopian federal forces are trying to advance along main roads from the south and the northwest of Mekelle and had got to within around 200 km (124 miles) of the Tigrayan capital, a diplomat monitoring the conflict said.The conflict has also embroiled Ethiopia’s neighbours. the TPLF fired rockets at neighbouring Eritrea last weekend and tens of thousands of refugees have streamed into Sudan.Tigray civilians in Sudan last week told Reuters that they were targeted by government-affiliated militia because of their ethnicity.

Some protesters also sprayed anti-monarchy graffiti.“The situation is not improving,” Prayuth said in a statement. “There is a risk of escalation to more violence. If not addressed, it could damage the country and the beloved monarchy.“The government will intensify its actions and use all laws, all articles, to take action against protesters who broke the law.”It did not specify whether this included Article 112 of the criminal code, which forbids insulting the monarchy. Prayuth said earlier this year that it was not being used for the moment at the request of the king.Related CoverageProtesting the Thai way: with pork barbecue“This could mean they are using Article 112 to arrest protest leaders,” said activist Tanawat Wongchai on Twitter. “Is this a compromise?”Although the Royal Palace has not commented on the protests, the king recently referred to Thailand as a “land of compromise” - a phrase that has been treated with scorn by protesters.Outraged by the anti-monarchy graffiti at Wednesday’s demonstration, some royalists called for the application of Article 112 in posts on social media.Dozens of protesters, including many of the most prominent leaders, have been arrested on a variety of charges in recent months, though not for criticising the monarchy.A major protest is planned at the Crown Property Bureau on Nov. 25 over the management of the palace fortune, which the king has taken into his personal control. The fund is valued in the tens of billions of dollars.Protesters said there would be seven more days of demonstrations after that.Additional reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng and Petra Mahira; Writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Mick Tsikas Australia said on Thursday that 19 current and former soldiers will be referred for potential criminal prosecution for allegedly killing the 39 Afghan locals.Detailing the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the conduct of special forces personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, Australia’s General Angus John Campbell said there was credible information of 39 unlawful killings by 25 Australian Special Forces personnel in 23 separate incidents.All of those kills were outside the “heat of battle”, Campbell said.“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” Campbell told reporters in Canberra.“The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”The report said the majority of those killed, which included prisoners, farmers and other Afghan locals, were captured when they were killed and therefore protected under international law.Following the recommendations of the report, Campbell said 19 current and former members of Australia’s military will be referred to a soon-to-be appointed special investigator to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.Australia’s Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said last week that Canberra had been advised that local prosecution would negate charges at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.Related CoverageFactbox: Quotes from Australia's Defence Force report into Afghanistan‘BLOODING’Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier warned the report would include “difficult and hard news for Australians”, but few expected some of the most shocking revelations.While the report was heavily redacted, it included allegations that senior special forces personnel ordered the killing of unarmed Afghans.“There is credible information that junior soldiers were required by their patrol commanders to shoot a prisoner, in order to achieve the soldier’s first kill, in a practice that was known as ‘blooding’,” the report read.Once a person had been killed, those allegedly responsible would stage a fight scene with foreign weapons or equipment to justify their action, the report concluded.The actions did not immediately come to light due to what the report concluded was a culture of secrecy andcompartmentalisation in which information was kept and controlled within patrols.The veil of secrecy was a key reason that the allegations took so long to come to light.Although it has been the subject of rumour, Australia’s official investigation only began after the publication of classified documents about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.A former military lawyer, David McBride, has been charged with providing the classified papers to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He admits that he supplied the papers, but says it is in the national interest.The four-year inquiry was conducted by New South Wales state Judge Paul Brereton, who was appointed by the Inspector-General of Defence in 2016 to investigate rumours of war crimes in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2016.The inquiry examined more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images, and interviewed 423 witnesses under oath.The report recommended Canberra should compensate victims’ families even without a successful prosecution.Campbell said he would seek to revoke citations for special operations task groups that served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013.The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani’s office wrote on Twitter.Australia has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002 as part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Taliban militia.Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.Reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Stephen Coates and Michael PerryOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

They said they were organising their own graduation after the university said it would be held online because of the risk of the novel coronavirus.“I want to pass on the spirit ... so the next generation of students don’t forget what happened last year,” said Philip, a social sciences graduate who declined to give his last name.In November last year, campuses of CUHK and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) saw prolonged clashes between students and riot police, with protesters firing petrol bombs from catapults and using bows and arrows and police responding with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets.The PolyU campus was surrounded by police for more than a week, with some students staging dramatic escapes through sewers rather than hand themselves in to police.On Thursday, the students held black balloons and a banner reading “Happy graduation, CU rioters”. They chanted pro-democracy slogans and brandished the three-finger “Hunger Games” salute, in a nod to the gesture of defiance adopted by anti-government protests in Thailand.Some of the graduates reconstructed a battle scene, posing for pictures as they waved flags and showed how they had used umbrellas as shields.Protests in Hong Kong snowballed in June 2019 after years of resentment over what many residents see as meddling by the Chinese government in freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The novel coronavirus, and a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing this year in response to the protests, have largely stifled the demonstrations.Reporting by Jessie Pang and Sharon Tam; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Residents flocked to supermarkets to load up with supplies until late on Wednesday.The state, home to about 1.8 million people, has recorded 23 cases from the latest cluster.There were no new infections to report on Thursday while 3,200 close contacts of the infected were in quarantine, the state’s chief public health officer, Nicola Spurrier, told a news conference.Authorities have imposed the six-day lockdown to stamp out what the state premier described as a highly contagious outbreak of the coronavirus linked to a traveller who returned from Britain.“We’ve had to take this extreme action, this important intervention, to put a circuit breaker in place to deal with this disease,” Premier Steven Marshall told national broadcast ABC.“We have a particularly difficult strain of the disease, which is showing no symptoms for people who become infected,” he added.When asked if six days would be enough, Marshall said: “I’m advised that that will be the time required to knock out those transmission chains for this particular strain.”Experts said it was still unclear whether South Australia was experiencing a new virus strain as genomic data was not yet available.“Moreover, the circulating UK strains aren’t different from what is circulating in other areas, suggesting it is unlikely there is a ‘UK super strain’,” said professor Nigel McMillan, director in infectious diseases and immunology at Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University.“Of course, a novel strain might have arisen very recently so we await the evidence.”Elsewhere, Victoria state, which was the epicentre of Australia’s nearly 28,000 cases until last month, clocked its 20th straight day of no new cases. New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, also reported zero local cases.South Australia’s lockdown casts a shadow on optimism about a strong and swift recovery for the country’s A$2 trillion economy ahead of Christmas, just as Victoria was coming out of its 112-day isolation.“Overall activity over the last fortnight picked up sharply around Australia as restrictions eased in Victoria and some (state) borders opened,” ANZ bank economists said.“The unfortunate outbreak in South Australia though could impact overall activity figures in the lead up to the holiday season.”Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Aurora Ellis, Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The former Sandvik SAND.ST boss has said ABB has been weighed down by a business model that was too complicated.Slimming down and disposing of businesses is the current trend in industrial companies, with rival Siemens SIEGn.DE floating its turbines business earlier this year and selling its Flender gear box unit.Earlier this year, ABB completed the sale of its power grids business to Hitachi 6501.T, and said it would return cash proceeds of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion to investors.Rosengren said all three business units were “high quality” with profit margins above the group margin corridor of 14% to 16%. Among the options being explored are complete sales or spin offs.“In this process, we will seek the best value-accretive solution for ABB and those businesses and not put ourselves under time pressure,” said Rosengren, adding portfolio reviews would remain in place.No deals are yet in place, although ABB is open to selling to industry buyers, investors or trying to separate and float the businesses.ABB’s mechanical power transmission unit makes products including bearings used in industrial food processing operations and belted drives for conveyors in giant coal mines.The business, called Dodge, had 2019 sales of $575 million with 90% of it coming from the Americas.The biggest unit in the clear out is turbocharging which had sales of $800 million, with half of its business in Europe. The unit is a big supplier to the marine industry where its products boost performance of big diesel engines, including those in giant ocean-going ships.The power conversion unit supplies the telecoms sector with clients including Verizon VZ.N and AT&T T.N.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  The data, reported in part last month but published in full in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, suggest that those aged over 70 - who are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19 - could build robust immunity to the pandemic disease, researchers said.“The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,” said Maheshi Ramasamy, a consultant and a co-lead investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group.“The populations at greatest risk of serious COVID-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults. We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions.The first efficacy data from those Phase III trials is “possible in the coming weeks”, the Lancet report said.The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.But rival drugmakers Pfizer Inc PFE.N, BioNTech 22UAy.F and Moderna Inc MRNA.O have in the past 10 days edged ahead, releasing data from late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials that shows more than 90% efficacy.Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), the AstraZeneca experimental shot is viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees.The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55 years, 160 aged 56-69 years, and 240 aged 70 or over.Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets close to reporting results of its late-stage trials.Reporting by Kate Kelland in London; Editing by Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.“If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,” he said.The success rate of the vaccine developed by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer’s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine.“A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,” said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. “Today is a special day.”BioNTech’s Sahin said U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday.Related CoveragePfizer says analysis shows 3.8% of participants experienced fatigueExpert Views: Pfizer ends COVID-19 trial with 95% efficacySee more storiesAn FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment.COVID-19 RUNS RAMPANTThe final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc MRNA.O on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.“We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, U.S. officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours.The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group.FILE PHOTO: Syringes are seen in front of displayed Biontech and Pfizer logos in this illustration taken November 10, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration“This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,” said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool’s department of pharmacology.Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%.Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.DISTRIBUTING SHOTSPfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country.On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year.Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F).FATIGUE AND HEADACHESPfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.“These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,” said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge.Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it is on track to deliver data this year.Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon.Reporting by Michael Erman in Maplewood, N.J.; Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru, Caroline Humer and Carl O’Donnell in New York, Dan Levine in San Francisco, Elizabeth Howcroft, Kate Kelland and Josephine Mason in London, Emilio Parodi in Milan and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Writing by David Clarke and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Pravin Char and David GregorioOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Rachel Wisniewski/File PhotoIn a court filing, the campaign asked U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann to considering issuing an order that “the results of the 2020 presidential general election are defective and providing for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose Pennsylvania’s electors.”The request was part of a larger bid by the campaign to amend a Nov. 9 lawsuit challenging the outcome in Pennsylvania.Democratic candidate Joe Biden won with 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232 nationwide. The winner needs 270, and Trump would have to flip the outcome in Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, and two other states. Biden won Pennsylvania by around 82,000 votes, according to Edison Research.Trump’s legal team, led by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also sought permission from Brann to put back legal claims that it dropped on Sunday from the lawsuit. They said Republican observers were denied access to the counting of mail-in ballots, an assertion election officials dispute.The lawsuit also alleges inconsistent treatment by county election officials of mail-in ballots. Some counties notified voters that they could fix minor defects such as missing “secrecy envelopes” while others did not.Brann expressed skepticism of the lawsuit at a hearing on Tuesday.Trump’s case is deeply flawed and does not give Trump “any viable path to overturning the results,” said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor who has been tracking the litigation.The amended filing “does not offer any indication that a number of ballots sufficient to make up the difference in the election were invalid,” Levitt said, adding that “courts won’t toss ballots out (or otherwise stop an election tally in progress) without actual proof that the ballots in question were invalid.”Republican Trump’s campaign has filed a flurry of lawsuits in a long-shot bid to reverse the election. Trump has claimed without evidence that the election was stolen.A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed about half of Republicans believe Trump had the election stolen from him.Reporting by Tom Hals and Jan Wolfe, Noeleen Walder; editing by Cynthia Osterman and Grant McCoolOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuHong Kong’s Journalist Association had launched a judicial review in 2019 following widespread anti-government protests, arguing that the government had an obligation to set up a mechanism capable of “effective investigation” into suspected ill treatment by the police.An independent enquiry into police handling of the protests in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city became a main demand of the protesters last year, along with universal suffrage.The former British colony’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, has said the existing mechanism was sufficient to deal with complaints and there was no need to set up an independent system.The court disagreed and stated that the government was under a “duty pursuant” to Article 3 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, to establish and maintain an independent mechanism.“The existing complaints mechanism involving the complaints against the police office, with oversight by the Independent Police Complaints Council, is inadequate to discharge this obligation,” the court said in its judgement.Hong Kong’s Bill of Rights was introduced in 1991 as the then British-ruled city was preparing for its 1997 handover to China under a “one country, two systems” formula aimed at guaranteeing it a high degree of autonomy.The court ruling comes amid fears in the city over the erosion of its judicial independence by Beijing.A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday that authorities were working on reforms related to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, including its judicial system.The independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary is seen as crucial to its role as an international financial hub and an interface between mainland China’s closed capital system and the rest of the world.The court also ruled that police officers not prominently displaying their identification numbers also violated the Bill of Rights.Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The NBA had 108 international players from 38 countries last season.Serbia’s Aleksej Pokusevski (Timberwolves), Australia’s Josh Green (Dallas Mavericks) and Nigeria’s Precious Achiuwa (Miami Heat) were among the top 20 picks.VIRTUAL DRAFTLike this year’s NFL and NHL drafts, the NBA draft was held virtually with players, teams, and Commissioner Adam Silver all communicating digitally to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.The pandemic forced the NBA to halt play in March before it completed its season in a bio-secure bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida and crowning the Los Angeles Lakers the champions in October. The regular season is set to start on Dec. 22.The NBA draft here typically revels in glitz and glamour and Silver said he felt bad for the players and their families that the event had to be held virtually.“It’s a big disappointment,” Silver said.“We owe them a big party.”Reporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles, additional reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Grant McCoolOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

However, it is difficult for the Commission to find appropriate remedies to tackle an apparent competition problem as determining consumer harm can be particularly complex.”The ECA said the issue applies not just to internet companies but also businesses involved in digital innovation such as those in energy, telecommunications, financial services and transport.It said part of the problem lies in EU antitrust rules which only allow enforcers to act after wrongdoing has been committed.The Commission “needs to scale up market oversight to be fit for a more global and digital world. It needs to get better at proactively detecting infringements and select its investigations more judiciously,” said ECA’s Alex Brenninkmeijer who was in charge of the report.EU antitrust officials however have swatted away arguments that they are not able to do their job well in digital cases.“EU competition rules are flexible enough to deal with digital markets,” Commission Director General for competition Olivier Guersent told an online event on Wednesday.Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexandra HudsonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The former Sandvik SAND.ST boss has said ABB has been weighed down by a business model that was too complicated.Slimming down and disposing of businesses is the current trend in industrial companies, with rival Siemens SIEGn.DE floating its turbines business earlier this year and selling its Flender gear box unit.Earlier this year, ABB completed the sale of its power grids business to Hitachi 6501.T, and said it would return cash proceeds of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion to investors.Rosengren said all three business units were “high quality” with profit margins above the group margin corridor of 14% to 16%. Among the options being explored are complete sales or spin offs.“In this process, we will seek the best value-accretive solution for ABB and those businesses and not put ourselves under time pressure,” said Rosengren, adding portfolio reviews would remain in place.No deals are yet in place, although ABB is open to selling to industry buyers, investors or trying to separate and float the businesses.ABB’s mechanical power transmission unit makes products including bearings used in industrial food processing operations and belted drives for conveyors in giant coal mines.The business, called Dodge, had 2019 sales of $575 million with 90% of it coming from the Americas.The biggest unit in the clear out is turbocharging which had sales of $800 million, with half of its business in Europe.

Kiyoshi Ota/Pool via REUTERSTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) kicked off debates on Thursday on tax incentives next fiscal year to help Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga push his agenda on digitalisation and zero carbon emission backed by private-sector investment.The incentives are expected to help pivot the world’s third- largest economy away from heavy government stimulus and back to private sector-led sustainable growth, after suffering the record postwar slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April-June.“We must discuss how to establish tax system that responds to the premier’s calls for digitalisation and green society, which are pillars of a new era of with-corona and post-corona,” the LDP tax commission head Akira Amari told its gathering.Amari, a former economy minister who is close to the premier, steers debates at the tax panel, which will compile next month annual tax-code revision for the next fiscal year from April.The premier has set digitalisation and environmental policy as planks of his growth strategy, with the aim of accelerating innovation and investment in renewable energy and digital transformation.The tax commission also is seen considering extending tax breaks on low-emission vehicles as well as home mortgages to stimulate private consumption which has been hit hard by the health crisis.The tax breaks are expected to target next-generation lithium-ion batteries used for electric vehicles as lower costs of batteries could help electric vehicles replace gasoline cars, domestic media reported.Suga unveiled a plan last month to cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and become a carbon-neutral society, in an ambitious shift from Japan’s previous stance of aiming for carbon neutral in the second half of the century.He hopes digital transformation will streamline business and government processes and revive flagging growth.Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Amit Dave/FilesShares in the firm, controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani, have soared three-fold since the signing of the 8 gigawatt (GW) multi-plant deal, which Adani hailed as the “largest of its type, ever” and a landmark for India.However, previously unreported details of the agreement between Adani Green and Solar Energy Corp of India Ltd (SECI) reveal the agency has no “legal or financial obligation” to support the project if SECI fails to find buyers.This would be the first major SECI project without a state-guaranteed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which analysts say has been key to building up India’s renewable energy sector.When SECI floated the tender for the project in June 2019, it had said a PPA would be assured, but it withdrew the clause guaranteeing purchase in the deal signed a year later.“There shall not be any legal or financial implication to SECI in relation to such (unsold) quantum including associated quantum of manufacturing facilities,” the agreement, reviewed by Reuters, says.FINANCING RISKAdani Green has said 2 GW of generation capacity will come onstream by 2022, while the rest will be added in annual 2GW increments through 2025 as a part of the agreement.There are no buyers lined up for the project yet and it is unclear when SECI will be able to find buyers, a process that typically takes months.Auctions by the SECI usually attract greater participation because of the assurance of power purchase and payments.But the lack of such a guarantee could undermine investor and lender confidence, raising financing costs in a market like India where power demand growth has repeatedly fallen short of expectations amid a broader economic slowdown.The quality of “federal government-guaranteed contracts with cashflow payment certainty provide investors the confidence to deploy tens of billions of dollars”, said Tim Buckley, director at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Adani Green has said it would receive interim funding for the project from a consortium of foreign banks, and later with money raised from the capital markets.It has reassured investors of its ability to tap markets citing its sovereign grade rating.It declined to comment on the project on Thursday.“We have full visibility and we would be in a position to inform the market shortly,” the group’s chief financial officer, Jugeshinder Singh, said earlier this month.Adani Green aims to become the world’s largest renewable energy company by 2030. It has an installed renewable energy capacity of 2.8 GW and wants to increase that to 25 GW by 2025.‘ENOUGH MARGIN AVAILABLE’Gautam Adani has said the latest project can make a profit at the power price of 2.92 rupees ($0.0393) per kilowatt hour (kwh) agreed in the SECI tender. “At 2.92 rupees, there is enough margin available plus we also have time of 3-5 years to implement this project,” he said in June.The SECI tender for the project had dragged on for a year with the agency extending deadlines and raising the maximum bidding price to 2.93 rupees/kwh from 2.75 rupees/kwh.“SECI thought the final price agreed was on the higher side, and that’s why there was no purchase assurance,” an official familiar with the deal said on condition of anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter.Since dropping the PPA with Adani, SECI has removed the clause from some other renewable energy tenders too.SECI Managing Director J.N. Swain told Reuters on Wednesday potential buyers of power were consulted and “due processes” were followed during the auction and before signing the agreement with Adani.Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan in CHENNAI and Neha Dasgupta in NEW DELHI; Editing by Nidhi Verma and Himani SarkarOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board.”At a time of heightened global uncertainty, the continued rise of China and after four years of U.S. President Donald Trump’s international diplomacy, Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union has thrown its own role and global influence into doubt.The new financial deal comes just a week after Johnson promised U.S. President-elect Joe Biden that Britain was determined to remain a valuable military ally.The government said the increased military spending will cement the United Kingdom’s position as the largest defence spender in Europe, the second largest in NATO, and allow increased investment in areas such as cyber and space.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain was not growing its military budget at the expense of international aid, amid media reports that billions of pounds could be cut from the foreign aid budget“It doesn’t mean to say we are abandoning the battlefield of international aid, we’re still one of the most generous givers of international aid,” Wallace told Sky News.The full conclusions of the defence and security review - a study of threats and capabilities - will be announced next year.Editing by Stephen Addison and Toby ChopraOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It is the highest profile visit by a Pakistani official to Kabul since peace talks began between the Taliban and the Afghan government in the Qatari capital of Doha.And it comes days after the Pentagon announced it would reduce the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January.Due to leave office on Jan. 20 after losing this month’s presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump is seeking to end the 19-year war in Afghanistan, the United States’ longest conflict.Critics slammed Trump for timing the withdrawal to his own calendar as opposed to some kind of breakthrough in Afghanistan that would justify a major drawdown.And outside of Afghanistan, nowhere is the risk of instability greater than in neighbouring Pakistan.Mistrust has cloaked relations between the neighbours, due to Pakistan’s covert support for the Taliban during the past two decades. And as militants later began launching attacks inside Pakistan, it accused Afghanistan of stirring trouble in its borders.“Focus would be on further deepening the fraternal bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Afghan peace process, and regional economic development and connectivity,” Pakistan’s foreign office said in a statement as Khan headed for Kabul.Pakistan’s role in the peace talks has been key, according to Washington, particularly given its influence over the Taliban leadership, though Pakistan says that influence has waned over the years.Washington’s special representative for Afghan peace, Zalmay Khalilzad has a made a number of trips to Islamabad to discuss the peace process.Ghani had last visited Pakistan in June 2019, according to Pakistan’s foreign office.A spokesman for the Afghan presidential palace, Dawa Khan Minapal, said the main purpose of the visit would be bilateral trade and economic relations, but the fight against militancy in the region would also be at the top of the agenda.“The focus will be mainly on the peace process but we won’t keep our hopes high,” said a source in the Afghan presidential palace.Violence has remained high in Afghanistan despite the ongoing peace process.During the past six months the Taliban have carried out 53 suicide attacks, while 1,210 civilians were among the thousands killed in violence linked to the insurgency, according to Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry.Reporting by Adbul Qadir Sediqi and Orooj Hakimi in Kabul and Charlotte Greenfield in Islamabad; Additional reporting by Hamid Shalizi; Writing by Gibran Peshimam; Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Election officials there said recount results due to be announced on Thursday were not likely to overturn Biden’s 14,000-vote victory in the state. They also said the recount would not provide evidence for Trump’s unsupported claims of widespread fraud.“He’s been misinformed on that front,” Gabriel Sterling, the state’s voting system manager, told reporters.Election officials in Wisconsin likewise said that a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign would not reverse the Republican incumbent’s loss in that state, which he won in 2016.Trump himself has stayed out of the public eye while venting his anger on Twitter. His election-related lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan have met with little courtroom success.Trump’s refusal to concede the Nov. 3 election is blocking the smooth transition to a new administration and complicating Biden’s response to the coronavirus pandemic when he takes office on Jan. 20.Opinion polls show Trump’s unfounded claims about the election having been “rigged” have a political benefit, with as many as half of Trump’s fellow Republicans believing them, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Arizona’s top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, said she faced escalating threats of violence and blamed Trump for spreading misinformation to undermine trust in the results.The president is holding out hope that a manual recount ordered by Georgia can erase Biden’s lead there. The state’s top election official said that was unlikely.Related CoverageGeorgia recount not likely to change Biden victory: state official“I don’t believe at the end of the day it’ll change the total results,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told CNN.As of Wednesday morning, Biden’s lead over Trump had fallen to 12,781 ballots, down from 14,156 previously, according to Sterling, the state voting system manager. Sterling said he expected the recount to be completed by midnight EST on Wednesday (0500 GMT Thursday) and certified by the state on Friday.In Wisconsin, the state Elections Commission said it would oversee recounts in two heavily Democratic counties - Milwaukee and Dane, which includes Madison - after the Trump campaign paid $3 million, less than the $7.9 million estimated cost of a statewide recount.Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said a recount would start on Friday and finish within days. He said the recount would probably not change the tally significantly. “Certainly nothing anywhere near what would be required for changing the outcomes,” he said.Biden won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes to lead Trump 49.5% to 48.8%.In the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the election winner, Biden captured 306 votes to Trump’s 232. He won the popular vote by more than 5.8 million.To remain in office, Trump would need to overturn results in at least three large and closely competitive states to reach the threshold of 270 electoral votes. That would be unprecedented.Slideshow ( 3 images )FALSE CLAIM ON DETROITTrump is also challenging results in Michigan, falsely claiming on Wednesday that the number of votes in Detroit had surpassed the number of residents. The largest city in the state is heavily Democratic.“In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!” he tweeted.City records show that 250,138 votes were cast there in the presidential election. That is a little more than a third of the city’s population, which according to the U.S. Census Bureau is 670,031.The state’s top election official said all counties, including Detroit’s Wayne County, had certified their tallies.Slideshow ( 3 images )In Pennsylvania, Trump’s campaign sought to reintroduce claims to a lawsuit it dropped three days ago that alleged that Republican observers were not allowed to watch ballot counting. Lawyers said they had dropped the claims because of miscommunication.Earlier in the day, the state Supreme Court said it would hear an appeal in a separate case challenging thousands of mail-in votes in Philadelphia.Biden held a virtual meeting on Wednesday with frontline healthcare workers in Delaware who complained about a lack of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests for themselves.He warned that the delay in declaring him the election winner could mean that “soon we’re going to be behind by weeks or months being able to put together the whole initiative” to distribute coronavirus vaccines when they become available.The General Services Administration agency, run by a Trump appointee, has yet to formally declare an election winner. Biden’s team says that is hindering coordination with the current White House coronavirus task force.States face a Dec. 8 deadline to certify election results in time for the official Electoral College vote on Dec. 14.Congress is scheduled to count the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, which is normally a formality. But Trump supporters in the Senate and House of Representatives could object to the results in a final, desperate attempt to deprive Biden of 270 electoral votes and turn the final decision over to the House.Election officials from both parties, across the United States, have said there is no evidence of vote tampering, and a federal review drew the same conclusion.Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Tom Hals in Delaware, Jason Lange, Doina Chiacu, John Whitesides and Simon Lewis in Washington; Jan Wolfe in Boston; Writing by Andy Sullivan and Alistair Bell; Editing by Ross Colvin, Howard Goller and Peter CooneyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Giuliani began an investigation into now President-elect Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.Last month, Giuliani drew attention when he appeared in a satire film by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. The plot revolves around attempts by the character Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyevto to marry off his 15 year-old daughter to Vice President Mike Pence or, failing that, Giuliani.In the days following Democrat Biden’s election victory, critics of Giuliani derided him for staging a press conference in the parking lot of Philadelphia’s Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a business located between a sex shop and a crematorium and a far cry from the luxury hotel where Trump initially tweeted that the event would be held.JOE DIGENOVA AND VICTORIA TOENSINGThe husband-and-wife law partners are helping Giuliani bring cases contesting election results in battleground states. A former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, diGenova pushed the theory that lawmakers tried to frame Trump when they investigated whether his campaign colluded with Russia four years ago. Mueller concluded that no collusion had occurred.Toensing and diGenova are panelists on Newsmax, a right-wing media outlet. They also represent Ukrainian businessman Dmitri Firtash, who was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with bribery and racketeering.SIDNEY POWELLA former federal prosecutor, Powell in recent years has appeared as a conservative pundit on Fox News and other media outlets. Trump tweeted praise for Powell when she was retained by Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn in his criminal case brought by Mueller.This month, Powell launched a Legal Defense Fund for the American Republic to try to stop the U.S. election results from being certified in Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin.Powell has said without providing evidence, that millions of votes were “shifted” from Trump to Biden by software designed to rig the election.

And when politics redefines its purpose, I could be a hell of a lot more interested.”In the interview, he described his political philosophy as being “behind personal values to rebind our social contracts with each other as Americans.”But he seemed some way from having made any decision to swap acting for politics.“I still question how much you can really get done in politics, and I don’t know if politics is my avenue to get what maybe I am best equipped to get done,” he said.McConaughey, who won an Oscar for his role in 2013 AIDS drama “Dallas Buyers Club,” would be one of a series of celebrities who have flirted with, or won, political office in the United States.They include Presidents Donald Trump and the late Ronald Reagan, former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Carmel Mayor Clint Eastwood and former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura.Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Kenneth MaxwellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

56,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/determining-potential-schools-closure-1.5804809,"Rising COVID-19 cases spark talk of widespread school closures, extending holiday break","The possibility of COVID-19 forcing another widespread school shutdown worries Theresa Morris, as her seven-year-old returned to her Surrey, B.C., school only about a month ago. Last spring, Morris struggled to juggle her daughter Azel's schooling, her newborn, George, and her own work from home. At the start of this school year, rising coronavirus cases in the Lower Mainland led their family to keep Azel at home. Then, in mid-September, Morris tested positive for COVID-19.  She had mild symptoms and recovered during two weeks of quarantining apart from her partner and young children. In the meantime, however, Azel's frustration toward remote learning became too much. In mid-October, the youngster was back at school in person. ""She was so happy to get back to school, because she was a seven-year-old girl that was just shutting down mentally, and going back was a huge relief. For schools to be shutting down again and to go through this again is really worrisome. I worry about her education,"" said Morris, who saw a trio of schools in her Fraser Valley Health Region close due to outbreaks last weekend. Last spring, Theresa Morris struggled to juggle her daughter Azel's schooling, her newborn, George, and her own work from home. The prospect of schools potentially shutting down again is 'really worrisome,' said the Surrey, B.C., mom. (Submitted by Theresa Morris) ""Working from home and watching a baby and the seven-year-old, I don't know how I would manage that. I don't think I could manage that."" Rising COVID-19 cases, including inside Canadian schools, are sparking debate about the potential for another widespread school shutdown, with some proposing extensions to the upcoming holiday break. But determining if and when schools should close — and for how long — remains a moving target.  As of Wednesday, Nunavut becomes the first among Canada's provinces and territories to shutter schools across the board once again. All the territory's classrooms are closed for at least two weeks, with teachers delivering instruction remotely, after its COVID-19 caseload more than doubled from a day earlier to a high of 60 cases on Tuesday. The premiers of Manitoba and Quebec have acknowledged they're considering extending the upcoming school holiday beyond the two weeks already scheduled. Quebec Premier François Legault is considering extending the winter break. (CBC / Radio-Canada) ""To be completely transparent, what we are looking at is perhaps extending the winter break after Christmas and New Year's … so there can be a type of quarantine for children before they go back to school following these family gatherings that will occur during the holiday season,"" Premier François Legault said during his COVID-19 news conference Tuesday, after floating the idea last week. Christmas break won't come early in Ontario schools, but could students stay home longer? Ontario, however, is nixing the idea.  After consulting with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and its Public Health Measures Table, Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Wednesday that ""an extended winter holiday is not necessary at this time, given Ontario's strong safety protocols, low levels of transmission and safety within our schools."" Rob Fleming, British Columbia's education minister, has also said he wants to avoid closing daycares and K-12 schools completely even amid wider community lockdown measures. WATCH | What indicators inform the decision when to close schools? How do you decide when to close in-person schools?23 hours agoVideo1:46Raywat Deonandan, epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa, outlines some pandemic indicators that could inform the decision to close in-person schools. 1:46 Ottawa epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan is among those who believes that schools should be one of the last things closed. He looks to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's document guiding school decision-making, which weighs core indicators such as the number of new cases per day and test positivity rate alongside secondary indicators such as hospital capacity and community outbreaks. ""I don't think there is a lot of stomach for an outright closure across the province. There might be targeted closures in extremely hotbed areas, where the local health-care capacity is being stretched,"" said Deonandan, an associate professor in the University of Ottawa's faculty of health sciences. Hundreds of Alberta doctors, 3 major health-care unions join calls for 'circuit-breaker' targeted lockdown However, he does think an extended holiday break could present a timely opportunity — if it comes with a specific caveat. ""Over Christmas break, you're not having parties, you're not out socializing. Simply not being in school isn't the solution. It's not being at school and not socializing outside of school,"" Deonandan said.  ""Because there [are] going to be school closures anyway, as part of the holidays, it's an opportunity to keep the kids home maybe a week longer — and close some other things — to see if we can use this time to crush transmission in a kind of circuit breaker approach.""  WATCH | What is a circuit breaker lockdown? What is a ‘circuit-breaker’ lockdown and does it work?News7 days agoVideo1:58As COVID-19 cases continue to surge across Canada, provinces are implementing the short, sharp ""circuit-breaker"" lockdowns to fight the spread of the virus and prevent health-care systems from being overwhelmed. 1:58 ""Circuit-breaker lockdowns"" — enacting sharp restrictions including shutting down non-essential services, but with a defined end point — have been discussed in several regions. However, whether schools should be included in these types of lockdowns has been a thornier question. Many public health officials say schools have reflected, not driven, community transmission of the coronavirus. CBC KIDS NEWS | Schools could be closing. Here's what a 12-year-old thinks ""To some extent, to maximize the benefit of a circuit breaker, you could make an argument that school should be included at least for the first couple of weeks, because that's the kind of crucial period,"" said Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. If data doesn't indicate schools are contributing to transmission, ""I do think it might be OK to leave them open during a circuit breaker. ""If we cannot be sure of that, then I think it becomes much more important to consider at least an upfront inclusion of the schools."" 'To some extent, to maximize the benefit of a circuit breaker, you could make an argument that school should be included at least for the first couple of weeks, because that's the kind of crucial period,' says Edmonton infectious diseases physician Lynora Saxinger. (Martin Weaver/CBC) The overall decision about implementing more stringent lockdown measures, however, cannot wait for the school holiday break, according to Saxinger.  ""If you're in a situation of an evolving epidemic surge, that waiting till Christmas actually puts us behind, because the decisions around measures meant to reduce the spread immediately really are something that is time-sensitive,"" she said. 'Things are not going well at all' Virologist Jason Kindrachuk believes some communities in Canada have already passed the threshold to consider closing schools.  ""I crossed that bar a while ago. We are in a tough position, and I think that the time has been ripe for a while to be going through a very tough lockdown and bringing in those restrictions,"" said the assistant professor and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses at the University of Manitoba. ""We know in schools it doesn't look like there's broad transmission. We're not seeing massive amounts of superspreader events. But where the grey area is: once those kids leave and go back home or go out in their communities, what is the role that they play in transmission?"" 'We need to make those tough decisions and we need to accept that what we knew a week ago was not necessarily what we know now,' says Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor and Canada Research Chair in the department of medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba.  (Danielle Da Silva) Kindrachuk, currently based in Saskatoon to help lead COVID-19 research efforts through a university partnership, is concerned how quickly cases are rising in Alberta, B.C., Saskatchewan and the North. He recognizes there may be reticence from political leaders about harsh lockdown measures resembling last spring and summer, including with schools. ""The unfortunate reality is that things are not going well at all,"" he said. ""We have to be as adaptable and fast moving as the virus is. … We need to make those tough decisions and we need to accept that what we knew a week ago was not necessarily what we know now.""   While news of two potential coronavirus vaccines has buoyed many, Kindrachuk included, he urged people to keep in mind they are still some time away from being in wide distribution. ""We have to keep our eye on the ball right now. Everything that we've been doing to try and reduce transmission of this virus, we have to keep doing,"" he said.  ""Until we have everybody vaccinated and we have control of the virus, we are still within the throes of what the virus is throwing at us."""

The lawsuit will compensate former civilian RCMP employees, volunteers and even students who faced gender-based discrimination, harassment and assault between 1974 and 2019. Although it was estimated that about 3,500 claims would be registered, only 168 women have come forward, and with a Jan. 12 deadline, time is running out.  But the experiences of the women who have thus far come forward are extreme — they include grooming, stalking and rape. Eligible women may not be aware of deadline The federal court approved the class action suit on March 11, the same day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.  The media attention devoted to the worldwide crisis means some of the eligible women might not have heard about the lawsuit, says Jill Taylor, a lawyer with Higgerty Law, which along with Vancouver-based Klein Lawyers LLP, is one of two firms representing the bulk of the plaintiffs. ""They may not be aware that this class action is occurring and they're certainly not aware that there's a timeline to it, so that's a concern that I have,"" said Taylor.    Federal Court approves next $100M RCMP sexual harassment class-action lawsuit   In 1999, Joyce was 30 years old and in an unhappy marriage. She wanted out but needed to line up a job first so she and her son could be self-sufficient.  Joyce, not her real name, still lives in the same East Coast town where she worked for the RCMP in 1999. 'Who's going to believe me?' Though it was a volunteer position, Joyce felt working for the RCMP would look great on her resume. She saw working for the Mounties as ""prestigious."" But it wasn't long before an officer, 15 years her senior, began targeting her. First, it was comments about her appearance, sexual advances and unwanted touching. One day, the officer showed up in uniform at Joyce's apartment. He forced his way inside and raped her.  ""I knew I'd get it sooner or later from you,"" he said. ""I'll see you later. I'll be in touch."" After that, the officer began showing up at Joyce's new job, stalking her.  Joyce says she felt fearful and powerless. Her attacker was a police officer. He knew everyone in town.  ""I had nowhere to go,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Who's going to believe me?"" Grooming That's a common thread the all-female team working with claimants hears.  Violet is a social worker and a primary claims advocate (PCA) working with claimants, gathering their stories and supporting them.  ""There's so much careful thought and precision put into the grooming of these women,"" said Violet, who doesn't want to be identified by her real name because of the sensitive nature of the work. ""It's very clear that these members, the perpetrators, were quite practised in what they've done. Whenever I hear a story I can't help but think this person has done this to someone else before."" 'I'll always carry the scars' Cara Fall, who also has a background in social work and is overseeing the PCAs, says the level of fear the claimants come to the table with is significant but not surprising. ""If this is the RCMP and what they're capable of, who do you turn to?"" ""There is no safe place to go when the place that we're taught as children as the safe place to go becomes the place of danger and abuse."" Now, 20 years later, Joyce is still terrified to be alone. She calls her new husband her ""security blanket.""  ""I'll always carry the scars,"" she said. Eligible claimants to receive $10K - $222K In 2016, the first RCMP class-action settlement — known as the Merlo-Davidson settlement — covered female officers who faced gender-based discrimination, harassment and assault. In Merlo-Davidson, more than 3,000 women came forward, 15 per cent of the potential class. In this case, with the potential class at 41,000, so far only 0.5 per cent of eligible women have registered. ""Something's happened,"" said Taylor. ""We don't know what it is. It could be COVID, it could be fear. But it doesn't make sense to me that when you have the same members, the same perpetrators … the same environment."" The law firms are using a trauma-informed process — typically seen in health care — in its dealings with plaintiffs. Women who experienced harassment based on gender or sexual orientation are eligible for between $10,000 and $222,000 each. Three retired female judges have been hired as assessors to act as independent adjudicators. The panel will decide in each case if the claimant qualifies for compensation and will assign a level of harassment. Joyce says it's not about the money, though.  ""I needed to tell my story,"" she said. ""I really hope this movement drives change."""

Ford added that his cabinet will be discussing new public health measures for them in coming days that could be announced on Friday. ""We have to do something,"" he said.  Ontario reported an additional 1,417 cases of COVID-19 early Wednesday, and 32 more deaths linked to the illness — the most on any single day during the second wave of the pandemic which is currently gripping parts of the province.   The new cases include 410 in Toronto, 463 in Peel Region and 178 in York Region.  They push the seven-day average of daily cases, a measure that helps to paint a clearer picture of longer-term trends in the data, to 1,422.  Other regions that saw double-digit increases in Wednesday's report were:  Halton Region: 63.

Officials say 109 of the new cases are school-related: 92 among students and 17 staff. A total of 670, or about 13.9 per cent, of Ontario's 4,828 publicly funded schools have reported at least one case of COVID-19. Three schools provincewide are currently closed because of the illness. No extended winter break The numbers do not warrant an extended winter break for students this year, said Education Minister Stephen Lecce. Lecce said yesterday the government was in talks with health experts about possibly keeping schools closed for a period in early January. Classes would have continued online.  ""An extended winter holiday is not necessary at this time, given Ontario's strong safety protocols, low levels of transmission and safety within our schools,"" Lecce said Wednesday.

Of those, 127 are being treated in intensive care and 78 are on ventilators, three more than yesterday.

""As physical infrastructure and processes continue to be connected to the internet, cyber threat activity has followed, leading to increasing risk to the functioning of machinery and the safety of Canadians,"" says a new national cyber threat assessment drafted by the Communications Security Establishment. ""We judge that state-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop the additional cyber capabilities required to disrupt the supply of electricity in Canada."" Today's report — the second from the agency's Canadian Centre for Cyber Security wing — looks at the major cyber threats to Canadians' physical safety and economic security. The CSE does say in the report that while it's unlikely cyber threat actors would intentionally disrupt critical infrastructure — such as water and electricity supplies — to cause major damage or loss of life, they would target critical organizations ""to collect information, pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation."" Read the reportNorad asked Canada to 'identify and mitigate' cyberthreats to critical civilian sites Such preliminary attacks have happened already. The report said Russia-associated actors probed the networks of electricity utilities in the U.S. and Canada last year and Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actors have targeted U.S. utility employees. Other countries have seen their industrial control systems targeted by Iranian hacking groups and North Korean malware was found in the IT networks of an Indian power plant, it said. The threat grows as more critical infrastructure goes high-tech. Commercial espionage is already happening across a range of fields, says the CSE. (Shutterstock / Motortion Films) In the past, the operational technology (OT) used to control dams, boilers, electricity and pipeline operations has been largely immune to cyberattacks — but that's changing as manufacturers incorporate newer information technology in their systems and products, says the report. That technology might make things easier and lower costs, but it comes with risks, said Scott Jones, the head of the cyber centre. ""So that means now it is a target, it is accessible and it's vulnerable. So what you could see is shutting off of transmission lines, you can see them opening circuit breakers, meaning electricity simply won't flow to our homes to our business,"" he told reporters Wednesday. While the probability of such attacks remains low, Jones said the goal of Wednesday's briefing is to send out the early warnings. ""We're not trying to scare people. We're certainly not trying to scare people into going off grid by building a cabin in the woods. We're here to say, 'Let's tackle these now while they're still paper, while they're still a threat we're writing down.'"" Steve Waterhouse, a former cybersecurity officer for the Department of National Defence who now teaches at Université de Sherbrooke, said a saving grace for Canada could be the makeup of its electrical systems. ""Since in Canada, they're very centralized, it's easier to defend ... while down in the States, they have multiple companies all around the place. So the weakest link is very hard to identify where it is, but the effect is a cascading effect across the country ... And it could impact Canada, just like we saw in the big Northeastern power outage, the blackout of 2003,"" he said. ""So that goes to say, we have to be prepared. And I believe most energy companies have been taking extra measures to protect and defend against these type of attacks."" In the future, attacks targeting so-called smart cities and internet-connected devices, such as personal medical devices, could also put Canadians at risk, says the report.  Earlier this year, for example, Health Canada warned the public that medical devices containing a particular Bluetooth chip — including pacemakers, blood glucose monitors and insulin pumps — are vulnerable to cyber attacks that could crash them. Hacking attacks on government growing more sophisticated, intelligence agency warnsRussian group targeted COVID-19 vaccine research in Canada, U.S. and U.K., say intelligence agencies The foreign signals intelligence agency also says that while state-sponsored programs in China, Russia, Iran and North Korea ""almost certainly"" pose the greatest state-sponsored cyber threats to Canadian individuals and organizations, many other states are rapidly developing their own cyber programs. Waterhouse said he was glad to see the government agency call out the countries by name, representing a shift in approach in recent years. ""To tackle on and be ready to face a cyber-attack, you have to know your enemy,"" he said. ""You have to know what's vulnerable inside of your organization. You have to know how ... vulnerable it is against the threats that are out there."" Commercial espionage continues State-sponsored actors will also continue their commercial espionage campaigns against Canadian businesses, academia and governments to steal Canadian intellectual property and proprietary information, says the CSE. ""We assess that these threat actors will almost certainly continue attempting to steal intellectual property related to combating COVID-19 to support their own domestic public health responses or to profit from its illegal reproduction by their own firms,"" says the ""key judgments"" section of the report. ""The threat of cyber espionage is almost certainly higher for Canadian organizations that operate abroad or work directly with foreign state-owned enterprises."" The Communications Security Establishment Canada is pictured in Ottawa on October 15, 2013. The agency's latest threat assessment report looks at the major cyber risks threatening Canadians' physical safety and economic security. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) The CSE says such commercial espionage is happening already across multiple fields, including aviation, technology and AI, energy and biopharmaceuticals. While state-sponsored cyber activity tends to offer the most sophisticated threats, CSE said that cybercrime continues to be the threat most likely to directly affect Canadians and Canadian organizations, through vectors like online scams and malware. ""We judge that ransomware directed against Canada will almost certainly continue to target large enterprises and critical infrastructure providers. These entities cannot tolerate sustained disruptions and are willing to pay up to millions of dollars to quickly restore their operations,"" says the report. Cybercrime becoming more sophisticated  According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, Canadians lost over $43 million to cybercrime last year. The CSE reported earlier this year that online thieves have been using the COVID-19 pandemic to trick Canadians into forking over their money — through scams like a phishing campaign that claimed to offer access to a Canada Emergency Response Benefit payment in exchange for the target's personal financial details. Massive spying on users of Google's Chrome shows new security weaknessCSIS warns of security concerns linked to foreign investment in Canada Online foreign influence activities — a dominant theme in the CSE's last threat assessment briefing — continue and constitute ""a new normal"" in international affairs as adversaries seek to influence domestic and international political events, says the agency. ""We assess that, relative to some other countries, Canadians are lower-priority targets for online foreign influence activity,"" it said. ""However, Canada's media ecosystem is closely intertwined with that of the United States and other allies, which means that when their populations are targeted, Canadians become exposed to online influence as a type of collateral damage."" According to the agency's own definition, ""almost certainly"" means it is nearly 100 per cent certain in its analysis, while ""very likely"" means it is 80-90 per cent certain of its conclusions. The CSE says its analysis is based off of a mix of confidential and non-confidential intelligence and sources.  Canadians, politicians targeted by foreign interference, electronic spy agency says"
60,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/toronto-firm-dominon-trump-voter-fraud-1.5806983,Toronto company finds itself at the centre of Trump's unfounded vote fraud allegations,"Dominion Voting Systems, an elections technology company founded in Toronto, is being targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies as they claim the recent presidential election results were rigged by the firm — claims the company says are entirely baseless. Trump has sent a series of tweets about Dominion in the days since president-elect Joe Biden secured the 270 electoral votes needed to take the Oval Office. The outgoing president has called the operation — which also has U.S. offices in Denver, Colorado — a ""radical left"" company with a ""bad reputation"" that supplies states with ""bum equipment."" He claims the company's products are ""not good or secure"" and were manipulated by Democrats and other unnamed bad actors to swing the election for Biden. The firm supplies voting and tabulating equipment to counties in 28 states and Puerto Rico — machines that are used to count the lengthy U.S. ballots. Dominion equipment was in use in four states that proved to be critical to the end result: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. But this isn't the first time that Dominion's machines have been widely used during a U.S. election. The company, which is the dominant player in the election technology sector, counted 70 million votes in more than 1,600 jurisdictions in the 2016 presidential election that Trump won, according to data compiled by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. Dominion machines counted ballots in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — states Trump narrowly carried in that contest. Trump seized on a Tuesday social media post from Elections Canada which said the Dominion voting machines in question are not used for federal elections in this country. He tried to use the Elections Canada statement to bolster his claim that there's something wrong with how the voting company does business. ""Elections Canada does not use Dominion Voting Systems. We use paper ballots counted by hand in front of scrutineers and have never used voting machines or electronic tabulators to count votes in our 100-year history,"" Elections Canada, an independent federal agency, said on Twitter. ""THIS SAYS IT ALL,"" Trump tweeted in response. THIS SAYS IT ALL! <a href=""https://t.co/zZSspsJPe9"">https://t.co/zZSspsJPe9</a>&mdash;@realDonaldTrump A spokesperson for Elections Canada said the tweet was sent because its social media platforms have been flooded with questions about the security of the voting system here — and it was not intended to be a comment on Dominion. ""Our message on Twitter was meant to respond to the large number of questions we had received from people who mistakenly believed we use automated tabulating systems in federal elections. It shouldn't be construed as anything other than that,"" Natasha Gauthier said in a statement to CBC News. U.S. voters pick candidates for dozens of federal, state, county and local political offices — and, in some states, judgeships — and often vote on amendments to state constitutions in each election cycle. As a result, American ballots can be unwieldy and the counting process there is much more complex than what Elections Canada grapples with during a federal election. Canadian voters simply mark an ""x"" next to the name of their preferred candidate for Parliament. Dominion's equipment makes tabulating the results for all the disparate offices on the U.S. ballot easier to do. As his campaign's court challenges fail, Trump seeks partial recount in Wisconsin in bid to reverse election Trump's anti-Dominion rhetoric has been amplified by a number of his supporters on social media making unfounded claims that Dominion — which was founded by Canadian businessman and Queen's Diamond Jubilee recipient John Poulos — has ties to socialist Venezuela and that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's family and the Clinton Global Initiative have ownership stakes. Dominion made a one-time philanthropic commitment at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in 2014, but the Clinton Foundation has no stake or involvement in Dominion's operations, the nonprofit told The Associated Press. A former aide to Pelosi has represented Dominion as a lobbyist — but so have lobbyists who worked for Republicans. Poulos, a University of Toronto electrical engineering graduate, started the company with partner James Hoover after the 2000 U.S. presidential election debacle — when paper ballot results from Florida were contested for weeks. ""I co-founded the company in 2003 on three basic pillars: security, accessibility and transparency. We continue to be committed to these founding principles and delivering best-in-class solutions for secure, transparent and accessible elections. The voting systems that we produce provide high assurance that election outcomes are accurately and reliably tallied,"" Poulois said in a written statement to the U.S. Congress in January. 'Categorically false' Trump also has claimed — again, with no evidence — that states that use Dominion's machines shifted tens of thousands of Trump votes to the Biden column in an effort to swing the election. ""This Election was Rigged, from Dominion all the way up & down!"" he tweeted on Nov. 13.""941,000 TRUMP VOTES DELETED. STATES USING DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS SWITCHED 435,000 VOTES FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN."" ""Now it is learned that the horrendous Dominion Voting System was used in Arizona (and big in Nevada). No wonder the result was a very close loss!"" he said. While the company has been criticized for past missteps — a technical error with tabulator machines used in the 2014 New Brunswick election count delayed results for hours — the company says the claim that it can switch votes is ""categorically false."" ""Dominion does not have the ability to review votes in real time as they are submitted,"" the company said. ""No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist."" In this Sept. 16, 2019 file photo, a Dominion Voting System product is pictured in Georgia. (John Bazemore/AP Photo) The company issued a lengthy statement Tuesday to dispel some of the falsehoods about its operations. ""Claims that 941,000 votes for President Trump in Pennsylvania were deleted are impossible,"" the company said. ""The fourteen counties using Dominion systems collectively produced 1.3 million votes, representing a voter turnout of 76 per cent. Fifty-two percent of those votes went to President Trump, amounting to 676,000 votes processed for the President in Pennsylvania using company systems."" The company said counting errors in some states where its technology is used can be attributed to human error. An election audit in Georgia found 2,631 uncounted ballots in Floyd County, something Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting system manager, said was ""an amazing blunder"" but not one carried out by Dominion. Trump fires head of federal security agency who vouched for reliability of the election The U.S. intelligence community has backed Dominion's assertion that the ballot counting process has been secure and that the results should be trusted. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said last week it has found ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised."" Donald Trump's estranged niece says uncle is 'deliberately' refusing to concede election The agency confirmed that it is not possible for a bad actor to change election results without detection. Chris Krebs, a Trump appointee and the director of this agency, called the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history."" Trump fired Krebs on Tuesday."
61,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/election-recounts-challenges-trump-1.5806764,"As his campaign's court challenges fail, Trump seeks partial recount in Wisconsin in bid to reverse election","U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign said on Wednesday it was seeking a partial recount of Wisconsin's presidential election results as part of its long-shot attempt to reverse president-elect Joe Biden's victory. The president is also clinging to hope that a manual recount ordered by the state of Georgia can erase Biden's 14,000-vote lead there and is also challenging results in the swing state of Michigan. But election officials in Georgia said a soon-to-be-completed recount was not likely to change Biden's victory there. They also said the recount would not provide evidence for Trump's unsupported claims of widespread fraud. ""He's been misinformed on that front,"" Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting system manager, told reporters. Election officials in Wisconsin likewise said that a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign would not reverse the Republican incumbent's loss in that state, which he won in 2016. While staying out of the public eye, Trump has persisted in venting his anger on Twitter, where he has made numerous claims of election fraud to try to explain his loss, unsupported by evidence and demonstrably untrue. His election-related lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Michigan have met with little courtroom success. Biden has warned that the continued delay in recognizing him as winner could mean the United States will be ""behind by weeks and months"" in the preparations to distribute a coronavirus vaccine. U.S. president-elect Joe Biden listens to a question during a news conference in Wilmington, Del., on Nov. 10. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Opinion polls show Trump's unfounded claims about the election having been ""rigged"" have a political benefit, with as many as half of Trump's fellow Republicans believing them, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Arizona's top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, said she faced escalating threats of violence and blamed Trump for spreading misinformation to undermine trust in the results. The president is holding out hope that a manual recount ordered by Georgia can erase Biden's lead there. The state's top election official said that was unlikely. ""I don't believe at the end of the day it'll change the total results,"" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told CNN. AnalysisTrump's refusal to concede is legally irrelevant, but it could affect U.S. for years As of Wednesday morning, Biden's lead over Trump had fallen to 12,781 ballots, down from 14,156 previously, according to Sterling, the state voting system manager. Sterling said he expected the recount to be completed by midnight ET on Wednesday and certified by the state on Friday. In Wisconsin, the state Elections Commission said it would oversee recounts in two heavily Democratic counties — Milwaukee and Dane, which includes Madison — after the Trump campaign paid $3 million US, less than the $7.9 million estimated cost of a statewide recount. Biden won Wisconsin by more than 20,000 votes to lead Trump 49.5 per cent to 48.8 per cent. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said a recount would start on Friday and finish within days. Only a few hundred votes changed in the county's recount after the 2016 presidential election, he said. 'I concede nothing': Trump backtracks after appearing to acknowledge Biden winDonald Trump's estranged niece says uncle is 'deliberately' refusing to concede election In the state-by-state electoral college that determines the overall election winner, Biden captured 306 votes to the Republican Trump's 232. He won the popular vote by more than 5.8 million. To remain in office, Trump would need to overturn results in at least three states to reach the threshold of 270 electoral votes. That would be unprecedented. Challenge in Michigan Trump is also challenging results in Michigan, falsely claiming that the number of votes counted in heavily Democratic Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, had surpassed the number of residents. ""In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!"" he tweeted. Trump supporters protest in Lansing, Mich., on Nov. 14, after the election was called for Biden. (Emily Elconin/Reuters) City records show that 250,138 votes were cast in Detroit in the presidential election. That is a little more than a third of the city's population, which according to the U.S. Census Bureau is 670,031. In Pennsylvania, Trump's campaign sought to reintroduce claims to a lawsuit it dropped three days ago that alleged that Republican observers were not allowed to watch ballot counting. Lawyers said they had dropped the claims because of miscommunication. Earlier in the day, the state Supreme Court said it would hear an appeal in a separate case challenging thousands of mail-in votes in Philadelphia. Delayed transition could delay COVID-19 response Trump's refusal to concede the Nov. 3 election is blocking the smooth transition to a new administration and complicating Biden's response to the coronavirus pandemic when he takes office on Jan. 20. Biden on Wednesday held a virtual meeting with frontline health-care workers in Delaware who complained about a lack of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests for themselves. He warned that the delay in declaring him the election winner could mean that ""soon we're going to be behind by weeks or months being able to put together the whole initiative"" to distribute coronavirus vaccines when they become available. The General Services Administration agency, run by a Trump appointee, has yet to formally declare an election winner. Biden's team says this is hindering co-ordination with the current White House coronavirus task force. Republican leaders in 4 key U.S. states quash Trump bid on switching electorsTrump fires head of federal security agency who vouched for reliability of the election States face a Dec. 8 deadline to certify election results in time for the official electoral college vote on Dec. 14. Congress is scheduled to count the electoral college votes on Jan. 6, which is normally a formality. But Trump supporters in the Senate and House of Representatives could object to the results in a final, long-shot attempt to deprive Biden of 270 electoral votes and turn the final decision over to the House. Election officials from both parties around the United States, have said there was no evidence of vote tampering, and a federal review drew the same conclusion. "

In a written statement, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said there are 6,861 active cases in B.C. of people infected with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. With the latest deaths, the provincial death toll stands at 320. There are currently 209 people in hospital, with 58 in intensive care. There are now more people in hospital with COVID-19 and more active cases than at any other point in the pandemic to date.  Henry and Dix pleaded with British Columbians to ""put the brakes on the virus"" and help slow the second wave of this disease by staying local and following public health advice to prevent transmission. ""This second surge is putting a strain on our health-care system, our workplaces and us all. We need to ease this pressure so we can continue to manage the virus in our province and also continue to do the many activities that are important to us,"" they said. ""While your personal efforts may seem small or having little impact, the collective benefit to every community in every region is significant. Our safety layers are there to help protect us and they work best when we are all using them, all of the time.""  Public health is now actively monitoring 9,871 people across the province who are in self-isolation due to COVID-19 exposure. To date, there have been 24,422 confirmed cases of the disease in B.C. Wednesday's update also includes three new outbreaks in long-term care and assisted living at Agecare Harmony Court Estates in Burnaby, Menno Home in Abbotsford and Peace Villa in Fort St. John.  The majority of the new cases announced Wednesday continue to be in the Lower Mainland, with 481 or 63 per cent in the Fraser Health region and 210 or 28 per cent in the area covered by Vancouver Coastal Health. People who live in those regions are currently subject to strict restrictions that include a prohibition on socializing with anyone outside of their household. Henry has also advised against any non-essential travel. On Wednesday morning, Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum said the idea of mandating masks within the largest city in Fraser Health is on his mind, though for now he stills prefers to emphasize personal responsibility. ""I'm very, very close to saying that we should have mandatory masks,"" McCallum told CBC.  Help CBC British Columbia tell your COVID-19 stories Earlier Wednesday, Premier John Horgan said he is calling on the federal government to implement a ""pan-Canadian approach"" to non-essential travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the travel restrictions brought in a week-and-a-half ago in B.C., which advise against non-essential travel in and out of the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health regions, will be extended for ""the next two weeks at least.""  Stay informed by joining our CBC Vancouver Facebook group on coronavirus.   Later in the day, the premier said he had connected with faith leaders from across the province and encouraged them to limit in-person festivities for upcoming celebrations including Gurpurab, Chanukah and Christmas. ""The actions that Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in B.C. took to avoid in-person gatherings for Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas helped save lives and protect the most vulnerable,"" Horgan said in a news release. ""There will be a time when we can all come together again like we did before. Until then, thank you to everyone for doing their part. Together, we're showing that we're stronger when we come together in common purpose."" "

And with more than 10,000 active cases, the province cannot track the source of almost one in every three. Alberta reported 11 more deaths on Wednesday, bringing the total to 443, prompting more dire warnings from the public health doctor who has led the battle against COVID-19 since early March. ""The daily COVID-19 death count is a tragic reminder that COVID-19 is not just a flu,"" Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference. ""It is life and death. And often it is the outcome of choices made by Albertans who may not even know the victims."" So far in the month of November, 110 COVID-19 deaths have been reported, Alberta Health data shows. ""Almost one-quarter of all our COVID-19 deaths have happened since Nov. 1,"" Hinshaw said. ""If we do not change our trajectory, the implications are grim."" The province can't identify the sources in almost one in three cases of the illness, she said. As of Nov. 15, about 40 per cent of cases were linked to households or social gatherings or private events, she said. Another 10 per cent were linked to continuing care centres, four per cent to child care or K-12 schools, and three per cent to acute-care outbreaks. ""Every day about 250 to 350 people are getting sick, and we have been unable to identify the source of transmission,"" Hinshaw said. ""This puts us all at greater risk. This is why we put in place the measures we did last week. The measures are focused on settings where there is the highest risk of one case spreading to many if there is a slip in public health measures."" Hospitalizations climbing Another 730 new cases were reported on Wednesday, with 10,057 active cases across the province, a slight decrease from the day before. But hospitalizations continue to climb, with 287 people now being treated in acute-care for COVID-19, with 57 of them in ICU beds. ""We are in a terrible situation,"" Hinshaw said, ""and it is COVID-19 that is the problem, not each other. We need to view every gas pump, every walk through a mall, every pass through a store door, every stair railing or escalator as an opportunity to prevent COVID spread."" Alberta's top public health doctor said she has been disappointed by reports that some organizations and businesses are trying to find loopholes in the orders and are continuing to host activities. ""I have seen examples of fitness studios running group classes with a video rather than an instructor,"" she said. WATCH | Dr. Hinshaw disappointed in those seeking COVID-19 restriction loopholes Dr. Deena Hinshaw ‘disappointed’ in loophole-seeking AlbertansEdmonton9 hours agoVideo1:46Public health measures are meant to be a hard stop against the spread of COVID-19 and Dr. Hinshaw says she is disappointed in people and businesses that aren't taking them seriously. 1:46 Some team sport practices have simply moved to neighbouring community rinks, she said, and some teams continue to socialize together. ""I have heard people say that while we have communicated this is just for two weeks, they believe it will last longer, so they don't want to comply."" Any individual, group or business that chooses to ignore the measures risks further restrictions not just for themselves but for all those who have chosen to comply, Hinshaw said. 'Deadly serious' ""This is deadly serious. I have asked for kindness but I also ask for firmness. The need to control our spread and protect our health system is why I ask everyone, anywhere in the province, to abide by all public health measures."" Hinshaw said she continues to be concerned about the rising case numbers and the human costs. ""As I have said before, as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise provincially, we are seeing a corresponding rise in COVID-related hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and an increase in the number of frontline health-care workers who are off work because of a potential COVID exposure and the need to self-isolate. Alberta Health Service initiated surge capacity measures in the Edmonton zone earlier this month, she said, and continues to implement those measures in other zones as needed. More hospital spaces ""AHS is able to increase the amount of hospital spaces available to patients with COVID if they reduce the number of other patients in hospital,"" she said. ""This means reducing the amount of scheduled or elective surgeries and other procedures that might require overnight stays in hospital, and reducing the number of ambulatory clinic visits. Hospitals are increasing beds that may be required for COVID-19 patients by opening units not currently in operation, and equipping and maximizing other spaces, she said. AHS is also increasing ICU capacity across the province and can create temporary ICU spaces by using beds that would otherwise be used to care for patients with other conditions that require specialized care, such as cardiac units, post-operative recovery areas, and other areas able to support ventilators and cardiac monitoring. ""In short, AHS is preparing and working hard to meet demands,"" Hinshaw said. ""But there are consequences to these measures in delayed access to non-COVID care, and there is a ceiling to capacity expansion. ""We need Albertans to do their part. By working together to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community, we can reduce the need for hospitalization and demands on our hospitals and emergency departments.""  Alberta's deadliest day: Province breaks daily record with 20 COVID-19 deaths  November particularly cruel The pandemic began in early March and hits its first peak in late April. After a lull over the summer, a second wave began in October, and November has been particularly cruel. On the first day of the month, Alberta had 5,961 active cases. On Wednesday, there were 10,057 cases.  On the first day of the month, there were 139 people being treated in hospitals, including 28 in ICU beds. On Wednesday, those numbers had more than doubled, with 287 people were being treated in hospitals, 57 of them in ICU beds. The 11 people whose deaths were reported on Wednesday were:  A man in his 30s from the Edmonton zone. A man in his 60s from the North zone. A man in his 80s from the Central zone. A woman in her 80s from Calgary the zone; her death is linked to the outbreak at Mount Royal, Revera.

A joint-forces operation dubbed ""Project Siphon"" has linked the gang to drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering and a series of shootings, Peel Regional Police Chief Nish Duraiappah said during a Wednesday morning press conference. That includes the highly publicized shooting of 17-year-old Jonathan Davis — a bystander who was gunned down in broad daylight in Malton in 2019 — as well as the shooting death of 28-year-old Giovanni Delahaye in Mississauga. ""This organization has been linked to some of the most thoughtless violence our community has suffered for the last several years,"" Duraiappah said. The investigation began back in September of 2019, when officers started looking into a drug delivery network operating out of Mississauga and Brampton. Police eventually discovered the gang was linked to a large-scale drug trafficking network across the GTA that was moving large quantities of cocaine and fentanyl, Duraiappah said. Police say they have executed 83 search warrants in the region in connection with the group, and 88 people have been arrested. Duraiappah said police are expecting that more than 800 charges will be laid in connection with their investigation, including participating in a criminal organization, firearms offences, drug possession and trafficking, murder, and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Police make 2 arrests in 2019 shooting deaths of Jonathan Davis, Giovanni Delahaye Thirty-four guns have been seized, the chief said, alongside over $1.39 million in cash and $1.9 million worth of drugs, including 1.4 kilograms of fentanyl, 13.7 kilograms of cocaine and 187 kilograms of marijuana. ""We believe the seizure of these firearms has saved lives,"" Duraiappah said. Gang linked to multiple shootings Supt. Martin Ottaway laid out how the gang was involved in Davis's death during the news conference Wednesday morning. Ottaway said that on Sept. 14, 2019, a rival gang was gathered at the back of the apartment building where Davis lived in Malton. Two vehicles drove around back, and that's when seven people all got out and started shooting at the group. Police say this was all part of an ongoing gang conflict. Six people were struck, including Davis, who died. ""Jonathan was not involved in any gang crime, and was an innocent victim who found himself caught in the middle of gunfire,"" Ottaway said. WATCH | Security footage shows shooting outside Malton apartment complex: Gang shooting caught on surveillance camera leads to arrestsToronto16 hours agoVideo0:52WARNING: This video shows the moments a gang opened fire at a Brampton apartment complex in 2019. Peel police announced today they believe that the shooting that left an innocent teen dead was part of an ongoing feud between rival gangs. 0:52 Police previously announced that Safeer Ahmad, 19, of Mississauga and Jahvon Valdez, 21, of Brampton have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the deaths of both Davis and Delahaye. Ottaway also laid out how Delahaye died in October of 2019. He was stopped at a red light in a vehicle with three other people in Mississauga when a car pulled up on the passenger side and two people opened fire, Ottaway said. All four people inside the first vehicle were struck, and Delahaye was killed. The others were seriously injured, but survived. The two shootings were ""forensically linked,"" Ottaway said, and police eventually determined the same vehicle was used in both. Also connected to cemetery shoot out Police have also linked the gang to the shooting death of a man in Mississauga on Aug. 3 of this year. Police say the victim was a frequent customer of an illegal mobile pot operation called 6ixpensary that was being operated by the gang, and believe this association was a factor in his death. Investigators say Mahmoud Al-Ramahi, one of the leaders of New Money So Sick, was arrested on Nov. 12 and charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence in connection with that incident. Victim in deadly Mississauga shooting ID'd as Grade 12 student Jonathan Davis Al-Ramahi's arrest comes after a recent attempt on his own life. Police said two men approached him on Oct. 29 while he was in a vehicle in Nobleton, north of Toronto, and opened fire. Al-Ramahi was able to take off and wasn't hurt. That investigation is ongoing, Ottaway said. The same gang has also been linked to a shooting in a Brampton cemetery from Aug. 31, police said. Members of New Money So Sick were at the cemetery, Ottaway said, to celebrate the birthday of a friend who had been murdered in 2016. That's when several people showed up and started shooting, which resulted in a gun battle with over 70 rounds fired. Three people were shot and taken to hospital, but survived. Ottaway said that investigation is ongoing, and further arrests and charges are anticipated. ""We will not tolerate this within our community,"" he said."

""Right now, the entire planet is in trouble. If you look at almost every country, there are very few exceptions,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a wide-ranging interview with CBC News.  ""The European Union, if you look at the number of new infections, it's out of sight. The United States is out of sight. Canada, which was supposedly doing so well, is also getting into trouble. There's a lot of community spread.""  Fauci says the virus is primarily spreading at the ""household level"" among smaller groups of people who may not even know they're infected — something to be vigilant about as the holidays and colder months approach.  ""We've got to be able to test widely in the community for asymptomatic spreaders of the infection,"" he said by phone from Washington, D.C.  ""If you just test people who are symptomatic, you're going to miss a very large contingent of the spread of infection in the community.""  Vaccines on the horizon but a 'long way to go' Fauci, who has advised six U.S. presidents and has run the NIAID for almost four decades, said he was ""surprised"" by Pfizer and Moderna's early vaccine trial results, which showed over 90 per cent effectiveness, but said it's not yet ""time to celebrate.""  ""I would have been extremely happy if this were a 75 per cent effective vaccine. I had an aspiration that it would be higher than that ... but quite frankly, I did not expect it,"" he said. ""It's extraordinary to have two vaccines using a novel platform that had never before been used in an approved vaccine to have an efficacy so high."" InteractiveHow close are we to a vaccine for COVID-19? Both are mRNA vaccines that use a new technology to target the spike protein of the coronavirus, meaning no vaccines of this type have ever been approved for widespread human use. While it's still not known if the vaccines will provide long-lasting immunity to COVID-19, Fauci said, the fact that the Moderna vaccine also prevented severe disease in participants in the Phase 3 trial was ""strikingly impressive.""

Help is on the wayWorld2 days agoVideo1:26Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is telling Americans to see encouraging news about COVID-19 vaccines as motivation to be patient and follow basic public health advice, such as wearing a mask. 1:26 ""The next thing to do is to get the vaccine approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and get it out to the people who need it the most,"" he said, which would include front-line health-care staff, essential workers and those with underlying medical conditions. ""There will be a distribution of vaccines that hopefully would start by the end of December, and then go into January, February, March, April, getting the higher-priority people vaccinated first, and then the general population.""  Why rollout of COVID-19 vaccine could be 'the most difficult part' in CanadaWhat are the side effects of Pfizer's, Moderna's vaccines? Your questions answered Fauci said he's hopeful that people with no underlying medical conditions would be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-2021 but stressed that countries cannot ""abandon public health measures"" until then.  ""That would be a disaster,"" he said. ""I see the vaccine as 'help is on the way,' and it's the light at the end of the tunnel — but we still have a long way to go.""  Fighting 'anti-science, anti-vaccine' skepticism Fauci said it's not enough to have a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, because you also need to convince the ""overwhelming majority"" of the population to take it, which could be a challenge — especially in the U.S. ""There's a lot of anti-science, anti-vaccine skepticism in the country by people who are not convinced that they want to get vaccinated,"" he said.  ""Hopefully, the degrees of efficacy will be an incentive for people who might have been on the fence about getting vaccinated to actually get vaccinated."" Fauci has largely been the face of the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by this mural of him in New York City.  (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Fauci said despite the ""major advance"" in developing two highly effective vaccines in such a short period of time, people should not ""put down their guard"" in the coming months.  Second OpinionWhy lockdowns alone won't save us from the pandemic ""I would hope that it would be an incentive to double down even more with the classical and simple public health measures,"" he said, referring to wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, keeping physical distance, increasing ventilation and washing hands frequently. ""Those are very simple things that can go a long way in blunting the surges that we're seeing right now.""  Lockdowns and 'COVID fatigue' Fauci said politicians and public health officials at local levels may also need to step in to impose strict measures to control the virus, because a national lockdown mandate wouldn't work in countries like the U.S.  ""There's no appetite in the United States. We certainly are not going to have a central lockdown at the federal level, for sure — the president has said that's not going to happen,"" Fauci said. ""But what likely will happen and might be helpful is at the state and local level, where governors and mayors and community leaders lock down in a surgical way."" UpdatedA closer look at the vaccines Canada is betting on to stem the spread of COVID-19AnalysisThe lessons Canada can take from the U.S.'s mishandling of COVID-19 Fauci said authorities can target settings where the virus is likely to spread by imposing limits on the number of people gathering and shutting down high-risk businesses if necessary. ""They can do that at a local level, without locking down the entire community — when you do that, the economic consequences are severe,"" he said. ""We should be able to do that without necessarily locking down the entire country."" Demonstrators protest COVID-19 lockdown measures in Albany, N.Y., in April. Fauci said in the absence of a national plan, it's up to local and state governments to impose measures that can help stop the spread of the disease. (Bryan R. Smith/Reuters) Fauci said that while many people are experiencing ""COVID fatigue"" from a pandemic that has lasted the better part of a year, it's important to focus on driving down transmission as we enter the winter months.  ""I think we can combat that by trying to convince [people] that there is light at the end of the tunnel if they hang on a bit longer — [if we] double down on these public health measures, then we might actually have a situation where we'll have such control over the outbreak,"" he said. ""The only way to get out of this and to get the economy back and to get back to normal is to essentially put an end to the outbreak aspect of this — to get it so low in the community that it's not a big risk."""

67,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/19/australia-troops-war-crimes-xxxx-afghanistan,Australia finds evidence of war crimes in Afghanistan inquiry,"Australia said on Thursday that its special forces were suspected of being responsible for 39 unlawful killings in Afghanistan, as it released a long-awaited report into alleged war crimes committed in the South Asian nation.
Australia launched the inquiry in 2016, amid reports from whistle-blowers and in the local media of the alleged killing of unarmed men and children that the government initially tried to suppress.
Detailing the findings, General Angus Campbell, chief of the Defence Force, said the investigation found evidence that members of the Australian special forces had killed prisoners, farmers or other civilians, and offered his unreserved apologies to the people of Afghanistan for any wrongdoing.
The report “found there to be credible information to substantiate 23 incidents of alleged unlawful killing of 39 people by 25 Australian special forces personnel predominantly from the Special Air Service Regiment,” Campbell told reporters.
“These findings allege the most serious breaches of military conduct and professional values,” he said, adding: “The unlawful killing, of civilians and prisoners is never acceptable.”
Some of those allegedly responsible are still serving in the military while others have left the armed forces. The inquiry recommended the 23 incidents, involving 19 individuals, be referred to the police for criminal investigation.
In a letter accompanying the inquiry’s report, James Gaynor, the inspector general of the Australian Defence Force, described the nature and extent of the alleged misconduct as “very confronting”, noting there were additional allegations that members of the Australian military had treated people under their control with cruelty.
“None of these alleged crimes was committed during the heat of battle,” he wrote. “The alleged victims were non-combatants or no longer combatants.”







 
During the course of the inquiry, New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Paul Brereton and his team interviewed 423 witnesses – some on multiple occasions – and reviewed more than 20,000 documents and 25,000 images.
The team “encountered enormous challenges in eliciting truthful disclosures in the closed, closely-bonded and highly compartmentalised Special Forces community,” the report noted in explaining the length of the inquiry.
‘Blooding’
Large chunks of the 531-page report were redacted because of classified security information or because they contained material that could compromise future criminal proceedings.
The inquiry found the 23 incidents of unlawful killings would be “the war crime of murder” if accepted by a jury, and a further two incidents “the war crime of cruel treatment”. Some incidents involved a single victim, and others, multiple people, and took place between 2009 and 2013.
It also found that weapons had been planted on some of the victims, while junior soldiers were sometimes forced to shoot prisoners for a “first kill” as part of an initiation known as “blooding”.
Large sections of the more than 500-page report were heavily redacted [Lukas Coch/AAP Image via Reuters]The report said that it had probably failed to uncover all wrongdoing that had taken place during the years under investigation, and recommended a mechanism be set up to receive and assess any future allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan.
“We embarked on this inquiry in the hope that we would be able to report that the rumours of war crimes were without substance,” the report said, noting that all but two of the team were serving members of the defence forces. “None of us desired the outcome to which we have come. We are all diminished by it.”
A special investigator, who was appointed last week, will now determine whether there is sufficient evidence to move ahead with the prosecutions.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week warned the report would contain “difficult and hard news for Australians”.
The release of the report came after Morrison spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
“The Prime Minister of Australia expressed his deepest sorrow over the misconduct by some Australian troops in Afghanistan,” Ghani’s office wrote on Twitter.
Al Jazeera’s Nicola Gage, reporting from Canberra, said that while any criminal cases could take years, the Australian Defence Force is expected to establish a fund to provide compensation to the families of the victims.

In the years since, a series of often-harrowing reports have emerged about the conduct of its elite special forces units – ranging from a prisoner being shot dead to save space in a helicopter to the killing of a six-year-old child in a house raid.
“Afghans have waited many years for this report to come out. And they shouldn’t have to wait many years for justice,” Elaine Pearson, Australia director at the Human Rights Watch said, calling for “swift and independent prosecutions” for the “deliberate and cold-blooded killings”.
Pearson told Al Jazeera she agreed with Australia’s decision to pursue justice through its courts, rather than the ICC.
“The ICC is a court of last resort. Australia does have the rule of law and so these cases should come to Australian courts. People should be investigated and held to account,” she said from the city of Sydney.
“But unfortunately, the experience from other countries, such as the UK, has not been very positive. We’ve seen cases where investigations have been opened and then shut down due to political interference. And that’s why its really important that [the Australian] office of the special investigator needs to be independent of the military and the politicians and it needs to have adequate resources to carry out its investigations.”
Australia has about 1,500 troops remaining in Afghanistan.
The US is also under investigation for possible war crimes in Afghanistan after the ICC authorised an investigation earlier this year. The court will also look into allegations against Afghan soldiers and Taliban armed fighters.

The Pentagon also outlined a modest withdrawal of US forces in Iraq that will reduce troop levels from 3,000 to 2,500.
Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said about 2,000 troops would be pulled out of Afghanistan by January 15 and 500 more would come back from Iraq, leaving 2,500 in each country.
The moves reflect Trump’s policy “to bring the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to a successful and responsible conclusion and to bring our brave service members home”, Miller said.
The announcement came days after Trump fired former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who had insisted on the need to maintain troop levels in Afghanistan to support the Kabul government while it negotiates a peace deal with the Taliban.
The drawdown will have less of an impact in Iraq, Al Jazeera’s Simona Foltyn explained, citing the number of US troops in Iraq that “has gone down to 3,000 as of September this year.”

#BREAKING: Acting secretary of defense Miller: Troops in #Iraq to be reduced to 2,500 by January 2021. This is a relatively minor drawdown compared to the reduction from 5,000 to 3,000 that already took place earlier this year.
— Simona Foltyn (@SimonaFoltyn) November 17, 2020

Al Jazeera’s White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett said the announcement was part of Trump’s attempt to “make good” on campaign promises made in 2016 to end “endless wars” and “preserve his legacy”.
However, the plans – which were first reported on Monday – stopped short of the complete withdrawal Trump had promised to carry out by Christmas.
The new plans will accelerate troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan in Trump’s final days in office, despite arguments from senior military officials in favour of a slower, more methodical pullout.
Halkett said the necessity and strategic values of the drawdowns are being questioned in DC: “This is going to be met a lot of criticism … it doesn’t please Pentagon officials; it doesn’t please lawmakers on Capitol Hill”.

Halkett said it could put President-elect Joe Biden in the difficult position of considering redeploying troops to Afghanistan, even as the US faces economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and public opinion largely against the war.
Trump has refused to concede his election loss to Democrat Biden, who takes office January 20, just five days after the troop withdrawals are slated to finish.
Shortly after Miller’s announcement, the top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, warned against any major changes in US defence or foreign policy in the next couple of months – including significant troop reductions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill that “a precipitous drawdown in either Afghanistan or Iraq is a mistake,” although he did not directly criticise Trump.
Separately, Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said the president is keeping his promise to the American people to get US troops out of war zones.
“By May, it is President Trump’s hope that they will all come home safely and in their entirety,” O’Brien told reporters at the White House shortly after Miller made the announcement at the Pentagon.

69,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/5/afghanistan-violence-jumps-50-percent-amid-peace-talks-watchdog,Afghanistan violence jumps 50 percent amid peace talks: Watchdog,"Violent attacks in Afghanistan have surged by 50 percent over recent months, even as the Kabul government and the Taliban launched unprecedented peace talks in September, a US watchdog warned on Thursday.
Despite brief lulls provided by two temporary ceasefires over the summer, fighting has raged across the country as the Taliban launched devastating attacks on provincial capitals and security installations, with fears the violence may jeopardise negotiations.
Attacks against Afghan forces and civilians were 50 percent higher in the three months to the end of September when compared to the previous quarter, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in its quarterly report to the US Congress.
“Overall enemy-initiated attacks this quarter were also characterized as ‘above seasonal norms’,” the report added.
The watchdog reported 2,561 civilian casualties this quarter, including 876 deaths, up 43 percent from the April to June period.
The report’s publication comes as scattered calls to boycott the ongoing peace talks have been raised following back-to-back attacks on education centres in Kabul claimed by ISIL, but which some government officials insist were carried out by the Taliban.
Earlier this week, at least 22 students were killed in Kabul University in an attack claimed by ISIL.
Little progress has been made in meetings between Afghan government negotiators and the Taliban since the talks started on September 12, with negotiations stalled over the basic framework of talks and an agenda still undecided.
Both sides have routinely accused each other of upping hostilities and killing civilians.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the US envoy who negotiated a separate deal with the Taliban in February, has repeatedly warned that “continued high levels of violence can threaten the peace process and the agreement and the core understanding that there is no military solution” to the Afghan conflict.
US influence over Afghanistan’s battlegrounds is on the wane, however, with the Pentagon looking to withdraw all its troops that remain in the country by next May.
Confusion over the ongoing US election vote count has raised further questions over whether Washington’s withdrawal from Afghanistan after 19 years of war will continue on schedule or accelerate if Trump clinches another term in the White House.
The Trump administration signed an agreement with the Taliban in February, which called for the withdrawal of US forces and a guarantee by the Afghan armed group not to harm US security interests.

Democratic Senators Bob Menendez and Chris Murphy and Republican Senator Rand Paul announced they would introduce four separate resolutions of disapproval of President Donald Trump’s plan to sell billions of dollars’ worth of Reaper drones and other munitions, F-35 fighter aircraft and air-to-air missiles to the UAE.
The lawmakers said the Trump administration, seeking to rush the sale of the sophisticated weaponry, circumvented the normal congressional review process.
They said the US State and Defense Departments also refused to respond to inquiries about how the administration would deal with national security risks associated with the proposed sales.
Murphy was also concerned with the UAE’s “behaviour” in the region, according to a joint statement he and Menendez released on Wednesday.
“The Emiratis are an important security partner, but their recent behavior indicates that these weapons may be used in violation of U.S. and international law. The UAE has violated past arms sales agreements, resulting in U.S. arms ending up in the arms of dangerous militia groups, and they have failed to comply with international law in Libya and Yemen,” Murphy said in the statement.

The US and the UAE aim to have a letter of agreement for the F-35 jets in time for UAE National Day, celebrated on December 2.
The deal also includes more than 14,000 deadly bombs and munitions and the second-largest sale of US drones to a single country, the senators said.
The US Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committees have the power to review and block weapons sales under an informal review process.
“A sale this large and this consequential should not happen in the waning days of a lame-duck presidency, and Congress must take steps to stop this dangerous transfer of weapons”, said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Police in the capital Kampala fired tear gas and bullets to disperse Bobi Wine’s supporters, who blocked roads and burned tyres after news broke that he had been arrested in the town of Luuka and taken to a police station in the city of Jinja.
Irene Nakasiita, Uganda Red Cross spokeswoman, describes scenes of “panic”, while Evarest Kayongo, chairman of the Kampala City Traders Association, said it was “total chaos” in the city.
“The streets are empty … We have closed business because of tear gas and bullets,” he said.
Rosebell Kagumire, editor of digital platform African Feminism, said tear gas and bullets could be heard in different parts of Kampala throughout the day, but things had calmed down by the evening.
“It wasn’t just in the middle of the city but different neighbourhoods [too],” Kagumire told Al Jazeera. “But also, outside of Kampala different towns were also engulfed in some level of protest calling for the release of Bobi Wine.”
Kagumire added: “Things are tense. People are worried and we don’t know what’s coming next.”

It came after the Twitter account of Bobi Wine, a musician turned opposition leader, said police had violently broken into his vehicle and taken him into custody.
“The price of freedom is high but we shall certainly overcome,” said in one of the tweets.
Police spokesman Fred Enanga said Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, was arrested for violating COVID-19 guidelines that require presidential candidates to meet or address less than 200 people.

“Bobi has been arrested this morning in Luuka town, but we do not know his whereabouts right now,” the politician’s brother, opposition activist Fred Nyanzi, told the news agency dpa.
“We have not been allowed to see him and we don’t know what is happening,” asserted Joel Ssenyonyi, the spokesman for Bobi Wine’s political party, the National Unity Platform.

Multiple arrests
Since expressing his intention to run in the election against long-ruling, 76-year-old President Yoweri Museveni, 38-year-old Bobi Wine has been arrested multiple times.
He has won a large following, especially among young people in the East African country, where general elections are scheduled in January 2021.
Many young supporters say they are drawn to Bobi Wine by his criticism of Museveni’s government mingled in his lyrics. Others say that as a young leader, he is better positioned to tackle the challenges they face.







Bobi Wine’s large following has rattled the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party, and security forces have frequently fired tear gas at his rallies and detained and beaten his supporters, witnesses say.
On the day he was nominated early this month, a squad of military and police personnel used metallic tools to break into his vehicle. He was subsequently detained briefly and police used tear gas to disperse his supporters.
Museveni, who has been in power since 1986 and had the constitution amended twice to allow him to run a sixth time in 2021, is seeking another five-year term in the January polls.
“The demographic shifts are not in favour of President Museveni. Personally, I haven’t seen any other president,” Kagumire said.
“People are looking for at least a shot in the election. But the election ground is very unlevel. If President Museveni is campaigning with over 200 people, there is nothing wrong. But if an opposition figure goes with many supporters, he is arrested.”

72,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/where-are-we-at-in-the-race-to-deliver-a-vaccine,Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?,"The battle against the coronavirus pandemic shifted into a new gear this week after two encouraging sets of trial results raised hopes of successful vaccination against COVID-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease that has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide.
Nearly a year since the new coronavirus was detected, billions of dollars have been poured into research efforts and tens of thousands of volunteers have taken part in large-scale trials as pharmaceutical giants race to deliver, at record speed, an effective vaccine.
As the world is trying to turn the corner in the fight, here is what we know so far about the global race to produce a vaccine.
Who are the frontrunners?
US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced on Wednesday the results from the Phase 3 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine, which showed it to be 95 percent effective – the highest success rate for any candidate in late-stage trials so far.
According to the trial results, the vaccine had no serious side effects, and it was 94 percent effective in older adults, who usually are more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19.
It came just days after Moderna, also a US pharma company, published promising data that showed its vaccine candidate having a 94.5 percent efficacy rate.
Last week, Russia also said interim trial results showed its candidate was 92 percent effective.
The first vaccine to show more than 90 percent success was Russia’s Sputnik V. On November 11, interim trial results showed 92 percent effectiveness.
Overall, there are 12 candidates currently in late-stage trials, including the one developed by AstraZeneca in partnership with the University of Oxford. Its results are expected within weeks.







How does a trial’s Phase 3 work?
The third phase of a vaccine trial must enrol thousands of people from diverse backgrounds. Pfizer and BioNTech, for example, enrolled some 44,000 people. About 30,000 people were involved in the Moderna trial.
“The way it works is that half participants are given the coronavirus vaccine, while the other half is injected with a placebo, usually a saline solution. Neither the volunteer nor the administrator knows who is getting what,” said Soumya Swaminathan, deputy director-general for Programmes of the World Health Organization (WHO).
“You then follow the map and you look for the development of the disease … you check if anyone develops symptoms and you continue the follow up on the other people for at least 12 months.”
In the Pfizer-BioNTech trial, results were based on 170 COVID-19 cases. Of these, eight participants had previously been given the vaccine, while the others had received the placebo. What this means is that the vaccine prevented 95 percent of cases.
Moderna did its interim analysis after 95 confirmed cases of a coronavirus infection; just five of them had been given the vaccine.
Because of the emergency situation, a vaccine may receive emergency/temporary use authorisation by a regulator such as the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency before getting formal approval.
Pfizer said it will apply in the next few days, while Moderna plans to file an application in the coming weeks, once it has two months of safety data on half of the trial participants.

What does the regulator do then?
The regulator reviews the data and checks how robust they are. “Usually such reviewing processes can take a year or more, but in this case, it will take weeks,” said Amir Khan, senior lecturer at the School of Medicine of the University of Leeds and the University of Bradford.
If the pharmaceuticals get the approval, they will get a temporary licence for emergency use, while continuing providing data to the regulator. If findings are still positive after 12 months, then the regulator will hand over a regular licence.
Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally this year and as many as 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.
What are the implications?
Experts have welcomed the results but caution there are still many questions that needed to be answered.
“All results we have seen so far are based upon three or four months of follow-up analysis, meaning that we can’t say anything about the long term protection [of the vaccines], or about their side effects,” said the WHO’s Swaminathan.
“In other conditions, you would never use a vaccine with such limited time,” she added. “But because we are in the pandemic we have to balance between risks and necessities.”
With many countries currently experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, health officials are warning against complacency and urge governments and individuals to remain vigilant.







When will people get it?
There are also many questions about how soon everyone will be able to get a successful vaccine, as wealthier countries and blocs of nations have already staked their claims to the first doses. (Read more here)
And then there are logistical issues. The Pfizer-BioNTech candidate, for example, needs to be stored at -80 degrees Celsius (-112 degrees Fahrenheit). This means that it requires a cold chain distribution from manufacturers to airports to remote areas – a challenging prospect for poorer countries with a large rural population that are frequently hit by severe heatwaves and electricity shortages.
To ease distribution, Pfizer-BioNTech announced they will provide “dry ice pack” containers that are able to maintain a temperature of -70C (-94F) for up to 10 days.
The Covax initiative run by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) aims to pool nations’ purchasing power in order to distribute at least two billion doses of a potential vaccine by the end of 2021. The WHO said last month it wanted to secure 230 million doses for Africa. However, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that this will not meet the continent’s needs.
When the vaccines do arrive, the highest risk groups such as the elderly, medical professionals and care workers are expected to be prioritised, while those below the age of 50 and with no underlying health issues will be the last to receive it.
This means that some vulnerable groups could get vaccinated in weeks.
“We have been told to get ready to administer the vaccine to the high risk groups by the end of December, early January,” said Khan, a doctor at the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.

The US, which has now registered 250,029 fatalities, has by far the highest national death toll, ahead of Brazil with 166,699 deaths, India with 130,993 deaths and Mexico with 99,026.
President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, seldom wearing a mask and holding large, packed rallies while campaigning for the November 3 election that he lost to Joe Biden.
Trump – who has not conceded the race – and his administration appear to be blocking the transition of power to President-elect Biden until the Trump campaign’s legal challenges are settled.
On Wednesday, Biden warned, “There’s a whole lot of things that we just don’t have available to us,” including real-time data on personal protective equipment and the distribution plan for COVID-19 vaccines.







Keeping this information could slow his transition’s team’s ability to prepare to handle the virus, Biden has said.
Social distancing, mask-wearing and other measures are followed unevenly in some parts of the US despite a surge in recent cases and deaths.
New York City cancelled in-person classes and shuttered schools on Wednesday, retreating from its position as one of the first large school systems to reopen.
The country has recently recorded more than 1,000 deaths and 150,000 new cases each day.
Regions like the Midwest that largely avoided the first and second waves of coronavirus infections in 2020 are also seeing alarming spikes.
Two trial vaccines have recently performed well in tests, offering hope for the US and world.
Biden has appealed to Americans to wear masks and socially distance until a vaccine become widely available.

74,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/19/pakistan-pm-khan-headed-for-his-maiden-afghan-visit,Pakistan PM Khan headed for his maiden Afghan visit,"Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is set to visit the Afghan capital Kabul for delegation-level talks with President Ashraf Ghani on bilateral ties, the stuttering Afghan peace process and other issues, a Pakistani statement says.
Khan will arrive in Kabul for his first visit to Pakistan’s northwestern neighbour, where it has been facilitating peace talks between the government and the Afghan Taliban, on Thursday.
“The focus would be on further deepening the fraternal bilateral relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Afghan peace process, and regional economic development and connectivity,” said a Pakistani statement.
Khan will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and his adviser on commerce and investment, Razzaq Dawood.
The Pakistani prime minister’s visit comes at a time of heightened engagement between the two neighbours, with numerous Afghan government officials visiting Pakistan in the preceding months, including Afghan peace chief Abdullah Abdullah, speaker of Afghanistan’s lower house of Parliament Rahman Rahmani and Commerce Minister Nisar Ahmad Ghoraini.
In October, Pakistan also hosted Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hizb-e-Islami, an armed group that laid down weapons in 2016.
Agenda of talks
The peace talks between Afghan government negotiators and the Afghan Taliban in the Qatari capital Doha will be in focus during Khan’s visit.
Historic talks between the two sides to end a 19-year war in Afghanistan kicked off in September after the US had earlier signed an agreement with the Afghan Taliban in February.
While the talks continue, progress has been slow, and both sides are yet to agree on a framework for how to proceed.
On Tuesday, the US announced it would be sharply reducing the number of US troops in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 before current President Donald Trump leaves office in mid-January, accelerating the country’s military disengagement.
The announcement came as there has been an uptick in violence, with the Taliban continuing to carry out attacks targeting government leaders, security forces and civilians.
Following the US announcement, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned that a “hasty” withdrawal by the United States, which lead’s NATO’s coalition in Afghanistan, could lead to further violence.
“We now face a difficult decision. We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” Stoltenberg said in a statement on Monday.
Also likely to be on the agenda for Thursday’s talks will be recent Pakistani allegations that India, with whom it has fought three full-scale wars since the two countries gained independence, has used Afghan soil to “sponsor terrorism” in Pakistan.
On Sunday, a day after the allegations were made, Afghanistan’s foreign ministry “strongly rejected” the accusations.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after carefully reviewing the video of the press conference, rejects the allegation and reiterates that there is absolutely no evidence that Malik (Feraydoon Khan) Mohmand, one of the tribal leaders of Nangarhar province, was involved in the terrorist attacks on the Peshawar Agricultural University,” said the Afghan statement.

75,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/anxiety-foreboding-as-ethiopia-conflict-entangles-tigrayans,Anxiety and foreboding as Ethiopia conflict entangles Tigrayans,"Gebremariam Hagos*, a civil servant in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, says he has not worked for two weeks.
That is when months of steadily increasing tensions between the federal government and the rulers of the northern Tigray region exploded into open warfare. In the early hours of November 4, the government announced a military operation against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), accusing it of committing treason by attacking a federal army base and commandeering weapons.
As fighting intensifies in the mountainous region amid a communications blackout, reports have also emerged about a number of ethnic Tigrayans in other parts of the country being allegedly dismissed, suspended and even arrested from various positions in the military, police and civil service since the start of the offensive.
“I have been suspended from work ever since the conflict broke out,” said Hagos, a father of three who has been working as a civil servant for almost 30 years. “However, my superiors in order to keep track of me oblige me to sign a daily work attendance letter.”
But it is not just job insecurity and the fear of not being able to feed his family that has left Hagos worried. He said colleagues and friends have suddenly begun to cast a suspicious eye on him, often questioning him about his “suspected sympathy to TPLF”.
“I have always been a staunch defender of Ethiopian identity. However, for the last two weeks, my name, my native language I speak has been a source of suspicion over my alleged disloyalty,” he said.







Ethnic Tigrayans make up about 6 percent of Ethiopia’s estimated 110 million population, but for nearly 30 years played an outsized role in Ethiopia’s military, economy and civil service. The battle-hardened TPLF had played a leading role in a long-running military campaign that in 1991 overthrew the Marxist government of Mengistu Haile Mariam and then went on to become the dominant force in the country’s governing coalition.
That changed in 2018 when Abiy Ahmed came to power after mass anti-government protests. Since then, Tigray leaders have complained that they have been unfairly targeted, marginalised and blamed for the country’s ills.
The federal government says its operations are aimed at restoring “order” and “target primarily the disgruntled, reactionary and rogue members of the TPLF clique”.
Hundreds of people are reported killed so far in the conflict, with tens of thousands forced from their homes and both sides accused of committing atrocities against civilians. But with internet and telephone lines largely down and journalists barred from visiting the region, independent verification of the situation on the ground has not been possible so far.
Last week, the Reuters news agency reported Ethiopian police had visited a United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) office in the Amhara region neighbouring Tigray to request a list of ethnic Tigrayan staff. According to the internal UN security report cited by Reuters, the local police chief informed the WFP office of “the order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs”.
The Ethiopian government denied that ethnic profiling had taken place during the visit. Instead, it said the police were looking for suspects linked to the TPLF, not Tigrayans, and warned against any “misrepresentation” of the visit to the WFP.
In a statement on Saturday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it had “learned that a justified risk/threat of fear of ethnic profiling and discrimination has arisen” in the country, adding that it had visited 43 people in police custody in Addis Ababa.
“Some of the detained have reported that they have been arrested only because of their ethnicity,” the EHRC said, also noting the response by the police that the “overall operation has followed the applicable legal procedures and that most of the suspected have been released on bail”.
Aaron Maasho, a senior adviser and spokesman of the EHRC, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the body continued to receive information from certain parts of the country from people who are facing discrimination and exclusion on account of their ethnicity. “We are monitoring these claims very closely,” he said, “[and are] calling for due care to avoid the risk of ethnic profiling and discrimination”.







Abel Berhane*, a private small-scale businessman, said he was among those who have suffered discrimination after the start of the fighting nearly two weeks ago.
Berhane, who regularly travels to Middle Eastern destinations to buy parts for his shop in Addis Ababa, said he has twice been prevented from boarding a flight after security forces at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport checked on his kebele (locality) identification card.
“[They] told me I will only be able to fly out of Ethiopia once ‘my people’ [TPLF] win the war, while my friend from another ethnicity was allowed to board the same flight,” said Berhane.
Zadig Abraha, the Ethiopian minister in charge of democratisation, called reports of ethnic profiling a “total lie”.
“Every Ethiopian has the right to travel. We are a functioning democracy where everyone’s rights are protected,” he told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
“We have a list of those who are part of the TPLF junta. Anyone who is not on that list is free to go wherever they wish to go. The people of Tigray are our people. Their rights and freedoms are protected by our constitution just like every other Ethiopian.”
But people such as Berhane and Hagos said they were shaken by the recent events.
“I’m afraid to go out. I fear I will encounter danger if I go out of home,” Berhane said, referring to security checks taking place in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia.
“My fear is further exacerbated by not knowing the fate of my brothers, grandparents and aunts who live in Tigray,” said Berhane.

Hagos shared the heartache of being unable to verify his relatives’ safety and also expressed fear about the future.
“If the current conflict continues for an extended period of time and becomes even more bloody, I expect the passive hostility I’m facing to turn into active hostility and even physical attacks,” said Hagos, echoing Berhane’s concerns.
Both said they were pessimistic about what could come next, whatever the outcome of the conflict.
“If TPLF somehow comes out on top in the current conflict, I expect they will unilaterally declare independence leaving me potentially stateless,” said Hagos.
“If the federal government of PM Abiy decisively wins the conflict, I expect his administration would take revenge, by politically and economically marginalising Tigray and Tigrayans,” he added.

In a joint statement on Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing group also said the decision was a “clear breach” of a Sino-British pact that guaranteed Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms for at least 50 years after the UK returned the city to Chinese rule in 1997.
Hong Kong expelled four opposition legislators last week after China’s parliament passed a resolution allowing the city’s government to bypass the courts and disqualify any member of the legislature deemed to be endangering national security.
Such acts include advocating for Hong Kong’s independence, refusing to recognise Chinese sovereignty over the city and colluding with foreign forces, according to Chinese state media.
The move triggered the mass resignation of all of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy legislators, leaving the mini-parliament with virtually no opposition voice.
“The disqualification rules appear part of a concerted campaign to silence all critical voices following the postponement of September’s Legislative Council elections, the imposition of charges against a number of elected legislators, and actions to undermine the freedom of Hong Kong’s vibrant media,” the five allies said in the statement.
“For the sake of Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity, it is essential that China and the Hong Kong authorities respect the channels for the people of Hong Kong to express their legitimate concerns and opinions,” it said.

“We urge the Chinese central authorities to re-consider their actions against Hong Kong’s elected legislature and immediately reinstate the Legislative Council members.”
There was no immediate comment from China. But it has previously denounced foreign criticism of its actions in Hong Kong as interference in its internal affairs.
Legislators arrested
Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp has been under pressure since late June when China imposed a national security law in the territory that punishes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.
Three opposition politicians were arrested on Wednesday for incidents in May and June, in which they threw foul-smelling liquids inside the legislative chamber, while several others were arrested earlier this month in response to another chaotic legislative meeting on May 8.
Hong Kong’s government also postponed September’s legislative elections by a year, citing the coronavirus pandemic – a move the pro-democracy camp condemned as an attempt to thwart their efforts to build on their landslide victory in district elections a year ago to secure a majority in the mini-parliament.
The crackdown followed huge pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong last year.
Authorities have removed pro-democracy books from libraries, banned some protest songs and slogans, and arrested about two dozen people under the new law, including staunch Beijing critic and owner of the popular Apple Daily newspaper, Jimmy Lai.
The US has imposed sanctions on top Hong Kong officials, including the Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city’s current and former police chiefs.
US President Donald Trump has also ordered an end to Hong Kong’s special trading status, and halted its extradition treaty with the city. The UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have also suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong.

The student-led rallies are demanding changes to the military-scripted constitution and the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first took power in a 2014 coup. They have also called for reforms to the monarchy, a once-taboo subject, in the most serious challenge to the Thai establishment in years.
Tens of thousands of people on Wednesday packed the Ratchaprasong intersection in the heart of Bangkok’s shopping and commercial district, before they marched on the heavily-defended national police headquarters – led by a clown and a parade of giant inflatable rubber ducks.
They were accompanied by a Buddhist monk giving the three-fingered salute borrowed from the “Hunger Games” movies that has become the symbol of the protest movement.
Wednesday’s protest came a day after the most violent confrontations since the democracy movement began in July, when police fired tear gas and irritant-laced water cannon on protesters trying to reach parliament, where legislators had begun debating possible changes to the constitution.
“We came here solely because of our anger,” said one of the rally leaders, Panusaya ‘Rung’ Sithijirawattanakul.
Demonstrators carried inflatable rubber ducks during the rally in Bangkok. They have become a symbol of the movement, along with the three-fingered salute borrowed from ‘The Hunger Games’ [Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters]“Slaves of tyranny,” the protesters chanted outside the police HQ, as they placed dog food by the gate as an insult. The outside quickly became a multi-coloured mess of paint and anti-monarchy graffiti.
Many had come equipped with helmets, goggles and gas masks to protect themselves against any police action, and the yellow ducks were meant to be used as shields. Police barricaded themselves inside and made no immediate attempt to stop the demonstration.
‘We will not touch on that’
Police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said the protesters had vandalised public property and charges would be brought.
Protests have been largely peaceful, but Bangkok’s Erawan Medical Centre said at least 55 people were hurt on Tuesday, with 32 suffering from tear gas inhalation and six from gunshot wounds. It was not clear who was responsible for the shooting.
There were also scuffles with royalists who turned out in a counter protest.
Al Jazeera’s Scott Heidler, reporting from Bangkok, said that in contrast protesys on Wednesday were largely peaceful and people in high spirits.
“Today there is much more of a celebratory mood,” he said.

“We will not touch on that,” said Wirat Ratanaset from the ruling coalition of royal reform.
Prayuth’s supporters have a majority in parliament, and the entire upper house was chosen by the military government he led before the 2014 election.
Protesters next plan to rally outside the Crown Property Bureau on November 25 over the management of palace assets valued at billions of dollars.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn has taken personal control of the fortune.

78,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/what-is-happening-with-the-us-presidential-transition,What’s happening in the US presidential transition standoff?,"President Donald Trump has continued to refuse to concede the presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, as bipartisan calls have grown to allow a coordinated presidential transition between the incoming and outgoing administrations to begin in earnest.
In the meantime, Trump and his allies have launched a raft of long-shot legal challenges seeking to overturn results in several key states.
Biden, meanwhile, has officially launched his transition team, starting with a coronavirus task force, 39 transition advisory teams for the myriad agencies his administration will begin running once he takes office, and his White House staff. He has also begun to receive briefings from national security experts.
Still, the standoff from the Trump administration, which includes the president blocking his cabinet from coordinating with Biden’s transition team, has thrown the period between the November 3 election and the January 20 inauguration into uncertainty.
The transition period following the election normally functions on two levels, Bruce Jentleson, a Duke University professor and former Obama administration State Department official, told Al Jazeera: “One is affirmation, and the other is preparation”.
Supporters celebrate Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election [File: Joshua Roberts/Reuters]Affirmation is the loser conceding the election, “the play by the rules, the handshake that normally happens as soon as the results are announced”, he said, adding. “Those norms have been already broken. Even if Trump concedes today, the damage is done.”
Preparation is the massive undertaking of replacing some 4,000 political appointees, 1,200 of which require Senate approval, in about 40 agencies in the president’s administration, while “trading binders, doing briefings, and having meetings” with mid-level staff to assure nothing falls through the cracks. Those agencies oversee everything – the federal coronavirus pandemic response, national security, social services, the economy and trade.
Biden has particularly highlighted the need to coordinate on the COVID-19 response amid promising developments in vaccine technologies, as he has increased pressure on Trump this week.
“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” he said on Monday.
‘The way it has developed … is unprecedented’
The unusual standoff the country currently finds itself in is partially a product of its idiosyncratic election process, Karen Hult, a professor of political science at Virginia Tech and board member of the White House Transition Project, told Al Jazeera. Under that system, while victory is reliably projected by media organisations shortly after the election, the final results are not approved by Congress until just two weeks before the inauguration. That leaves a good deal of leeway for the sitting president.
Under the Presidential Transition Act, both candidates are required to have a “pre-election transition operation” that organises all relevant information and documents to be ready for a possible transfer of power, according to Hult.
But in the weeks between the presidential election and the inauguration, much is left up to a little-known agency called the General Services Administration (GSA). When the head of this agency, currently Trump-appointee Emily Murphy, “ascertains” the winner of the election, she unlocks further provisions in the Presidential Transition Act, including transition funding, access to agencies and the ability for incoming officials to pursue security clearances.
President Donald Trump has not made many public appearances since his election loss, although his motorcade greeted supporters during a march alleging voting fraud in Washington, DC [Julio Cortez/The Associated Press]“The GSA administrator has been given no clear criteria or metrics on which to base their decision of ascertainment,” Hult said. “Typically, what the GSA administrator has done is as long as it is clear that the votes have been counted, and even though there are recounts or court challenges, there’s virtually no likelihood that the outcome will be changed, they ascertain and move forward.”
If the head of the GSA does not ascertain Biden’s victory in the coming days, Hult said the “next decision point” would likely be December 14, when state electors vote, or January 6, when Congress approves that vote.
“The way it has developed since November 7 is unprecedented,” she added.
Coronavirus response
Republican Senators, former Trump officials, and even those still serving in the administration have increasingly called for Trump to move forward with a coordinated transition, with concerns particularly focusing on the coronavirus pandemic, as cases continue to surge to record levels in the US, and national security.
Tacit warnings have come from within Trump’s own coronavirus task force, with Dr Anthony Fauci telling NBC’s Today show he hoped to get the first vaccine doses out in December and to scale up in the first months of 2021.
“We want a smooth process for that,” Fauci said. “And the way you do that is by essentially having the two groups speak to each other and exchange information.”
Dr Anthony Fauci has warned against the implications of a delayed coronavirus response [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]Meanwhile, Moncef Slaoui, who heads the Trump administration’s vaccine project Operation Warp Speed, told the Financial Times he hoped “nothing interferes” with the operation.
When asked if that meant coordinating with the Biden transition, he responded: “I would assume, yes.”
Others have stressed the need to share information on medication and testing supplies, personal protective equipment, ventilators, hospital bed capacity and workforce availability to be ready to respond to the pandemic on day one.
In a letter delivered to the White House on Tuesday, leaders of the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association and American Nurses Association called on the Trump administration to share that critical COVID-19 information “to save countless lives”.
“All information about the capacity of the Strategic National Stockpile, the assets from Operation Warp Speed, and plans for dissemination of therapeutics and vaccines needs to be shared as quickly as possible … so that there is no lapse in our ability to care for patients,” the letter said.
National security
Three former secretaries of Homeland Security – Janet Napolitano, Michael Chertoff, and Jeh Johnson – in recent days warned of the risks of a delayed transition.
“Having a transition that begins right away, getting security clearance to the incoming team, giving the president-elect access to current intelligence – these are all part of the process of preparing, so that when a new administration comes in, they can hit the ground running and not have to figure out what the threats are and what the capabilities to respond are,” Chertoff, a Republican, said during a November 13 webinar at the University of Virginia.
Of particular concern is Biden not receiving the classified daily brief given to the president and vice president, as is the norm for a president-elect. On Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally to Trump, urged the president to give intelligence briefings to Biden even as he continues to contest the election.







In a letter delivered to GSA Administrator Murphy last week, a bipartisan group of former national security officials warned against delaying Biden’s transition team from receiving the needed security clearances.
“Each day the Administrator delays is another day that the Biden team will be without critical information to prepare to combat the threats that the nation faces,” they wrote in the letter, which was first obtained by Politico.
Those officials, and other observers, have also highlighted that the official commission on the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US found that a 36-day delay in the presidential transition due to a recount in Florida had a ripple effect of a six-month delay in staffing the national security apparatus.
The report concluded that delay left the US more vulnerable, and said future transitions should “minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking”.

Some 2,201 new cases were recorded across the country on Wednesday, with nearly 500 in the capital, Tokyo, a sprawling metropolis of nearly 14 million people.
City authorities later raised the city to the highest of a four-tier scale, but the move does not come with any additional restrictions on activity and Japanese media said early business closures were unlikely for now.
While small compared with figures seen in some other countries, the numbers represent a sharp rise for Japan, where testing is often less wide-scale than in other parts of the world.
“We are now in a situation of maximum alert,” Suga told reporters.
“I ask you, the Japanese people, to fully implement principles such as wearing masks,” he added, urging people to wear them even while talking during meals in restaurants.
Even with Tokyo at the highest of its four-tier scale on COVID-19, it seems unlikely that businesses will be required to shorten their hours [Issei Kato/Reuters]National broadcaster NHK said Suga had asked expert advisers to meet on Thursday and Friday to examine the growing number of infections before the government takes any further measures.
The government’s chief spokesman said it would monitor infection rates and the capacity of hospitals to cope before acting.
“We will respond appropriately based on conditions,” Katsunobu Kato told a regular news briefing.
Suga said he would support local regions if they asked businesses to close early, and that restrictions, including limiting groups at restaurants to four people, should be considered.
Japan has so far taken a comparatively relaxed approach to the coronavirus with few of the strict curbs imposed elsewhere in the world. Even a nationwide state of emergency that was announced early in the year carried no obligation for businesses to close or for people to stay at home.
Although testing has ramped up, it has remained comparatively low, with approximately 5,000-6,000 people tested each day in the capital.
Still, Japan has seen a relatively small outbreak so far, with close to 121,000 recorded cases and slightly more than 1,900 deaths since the virus was first detected in the country in January.

80,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/17/infographic-what-a-third-covid-19-wave-looks-like,Infographic: What a third COVID-19 wave could look like,"It has been nearly a year since the first coronavirus case was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December.
In recent weeks, there has been a lot of mention of countries entering a second or third wave. While there is no strict scientific definition to characterise a disease’s wave, plotting current outbreaks on a line chart can help us see whether or not a country has entered a new phase of infections or if it is still in part one of a continuous wave.
Here are four graphics that will help you understand what a third wave could look like and which countries may be currently experiencing it.
Global third wave or one big wave?
More than 55 million people are known to have been infected by COVID-19 worldwide. Some 1.3 million people have also died of the novel coronavirus, while nearly 35 million have recovered, data collated by Johns Hopkins University showed.
For many countries around the world, cases of COVID-19 are declining, while other countries are seeing significant spikes. Within each country, the pandemic is affecting different cities at different time intervals.
Taking the average number of confirmed cases around the globe, it appears to indicate the world has entered a third wave. This average is particularly influenced by trends in the United States and Europe, which collectively make up nearly half of the world’s confirmed COVID-19 cases, despite only comprising 14 percent of the global population.
The chart below shows the seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases around the world with annotations highlighting visual upticks.

Which countries are experiencing a second or third wave?
The chart below shows the seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases for countries around the world. To view your country, use the dropdown in the menu below.

The US, India and Brazil have emerged as the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases. By all accounts, the US has entered its third wave while India and Brazil seem to still be on one big wave.
Europe, where France reported the continent’s first case on January 24, continues to see a rise in infections, with several countries experiencing their second and third waves.
Cases in China have dwindled with the country reporting its lowest number of new coronavirus patients since January.
Iran, the first country in the Middle East to confirm the presence of the coronavirus on February 19, remains the worst hit in the region and is also experiencing a second wave.
It is important to note that confirmed cases are the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19. Test units vary significantly across nations. If countries with low confirmed cases are not sufficiently testing or sharing their data, they may have many more undiagnosed cases.
Visual timeline of the pandemic spread
The animation below shows how coronavirus cases reached 55 million worldwide. In recent weeks, following a surge in cases, Europe has overtaken Latin America to once again become the region with the highest number of known cases around the world. The US remains the number one country despite fears of India overtaking them after the South Asian country reported huge outbreaks over the summer months.

Which countries have the most COVID-19 deaths?
The animation below shows which countries have had the most COVID-19 deaths. Latin America has lost the most number of people to coronavirus followed by Europe and the US.

81,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/17/coronavirus-30-seconds,Mouthwash can kill COVID-19 in 30 seconds: Study,"Over-the-counter mouthwash can kill coronavirus within 30 seconds of exposure, a study has found.
Scientists at Cardiff University discovered mouthwash containing at least 0.07 percent cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) showed “promising signs” of reducing transmission of the virus.
Their preliminary report, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, supports a study published last week that found mouthwash containing CPC helps in reducing the viral load of people infected with the coronavirus.
It comes ahead of a clinical trial on patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff to find out whether mouthwash can reduce coronavirus in a patient’s saliva. The findings are expected to be published in early 2021.
Dentyl is the only UK mouthwash brand that is part of the clinical trial led by Professor David Thomas from Cardiff University.
“Although this in-vitro study is very encouraging and is a positive step, more clinical research is now clearly needed,” Dr Thomas told the PA news agency, as quoted by the Independent newspaper.
“We need to understand if the effect of over-the-counter mouthwashes on the COVID-19 virus achieved in the laboratory can be reproduced in patients, and we look forward to completing our clinical trial in early 2021.”
Breath of fresh air
Dr Nick Claydon, a specialist periodontologist, said he believed mouthwash can become an important addition to fighting coronavirus along with “handwashing, physical distancing and wearing masks, both now and in the future”.
There are more than 54 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally and restrictions have been ratcheted up across the US and Europe to curb spiralling infections.
There is promising news from the race for a COVID-19 vaccine as US biotech firm Moderna on Monday said preliminary data from a continuing phase three study of its experimental vaccine showed it to be 94.5-percent effective.
The news followed on from last week’s announcement from US drug giant Pfizer that phase three trial results for the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany’s BioNTech showed it to be more than 90-percent effective.

82,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/after-student-election-wins-lebanese-prepare-for-bigger,"After student election wins, Lebanese prepare for bigger battles","Beirut, Lebanon – Nagham Abouzeid did not think she would win – but she was not going to give up without a fight.
Every year since Abouzeid began attending the Lebanese American University (LAU) in 2018, the 20-year-old had supported independent candidates in student council elections – and each time, they lost to electoral lists backed by Lebanon’s establishment parties.
It was a usual affair in Lebanon, where the parties and affiliates of a small sectarian elite exert control over many aspects of public life, from unions and syndicates to business sectors and student councils.
Still, Abouzeid could not bear that the establishment was this year running unopposed at the LAU’s campus in northern Jbeil, historically a stronghold of the Lebanese Forces, a right-wing militia turned political party.
“I was very disappointed students had given up to this learned helplessness,” said the psychology student. “I said, ‘OK, they may win this year, but they aren’t taking seats by acclamation.’”
Then came the surprise. Independents won all the student council seats they contested in the October 9 polls, 14 of a total 30 at the university’s two campuses in Beirut and Jbeil. They also won the popular vote with some 52 percent. Last year, they won just three seats.
And last week, independents saw even better results at the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon’s most prestigious university, taking 80 of 101 seats, up from 24 in 2018 (elections were postponed last year).
Meanwhile, at Rafik Hariri University (RHU), named after the former Lebanese prime minister assassinated in 2005, independents on November 2 made their first entry and took four out of a total of nine seats, up from zero every year before.
At each university, the results were unprecedented, a reflection of the extraordinary changes Lebanon has seen in just one year.
Independent candidates won 80 of 101 seats in student elections at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon [File: Aziz Taher/Reuters]In October 2019, massive protests broke out against the country’s ruling elite, fuelled by outrage over a deepening economic crisis and decades of corruption and mismanagement.
Suffering from massive unemployment and a bleak future, the country’s youth were a driving force of the protest movement that brought down a government but has not yet translated into a shift from the dysfunctional sectarian system many see as the core reason for Lebanon’s woes.
Now, some view the series of student election successes as the beginning of a transition from the streets of protest to the seats of power.
“The people who voted for me are the people who will be voting for the next parliament in two years, and they are very sick and tired of these political parties,” Abouzeid said, referring to polls scheduled for mid-2022, when municipal elections are also set to be held.







Bellwether or nothing special?
Students themselves will quickly point out notable differences between student polls and local or national elections.
For starters, student elections are held according to a system of proportional representation; seats are not allocated by religious sect, and this year voting was made exceedingly easy, via an online portal.
In contrast, municipal elections are held according to a winner-takes-all system, while parliamentary polls according to a gerrymandered law that allocates seats based on sect and divides the small country into 15 electoral districts tailored-made for the establishment.
To vote, citizens must travel to their place of birth – often rural areas where parties have greater control and influence. This means that more than half of Beirut’s modern-day population of up to an estimated two million is not allowed to vote where they live.
These factors make it much harder for those running on independent lists to break in. In 2018, they won just one of the 128 seats up for grabs in Parliament, though other factors – including low name recognition and uneasiness over many candidates, who were little-known – were also at play.







“We don’t expect the same kind of radical shift at Parliament,” said Nadim El Kak, a researcher at the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies and graduate student in sociology at the AUB, who won a seat at the recent elections.
“Definitely independents will do better than before, but it’s a battlefield that is still somewhat out of our reach due to the electoral system and the scale of pressure involved.”
That pressure includes the massive resources poured by establishment parties into riling up sectarian feelings through media and advertisement campaigns, as well as organising protests and other events. Other challenges include the promise of jobs and patronage, buying votes and shepherding voters to rural areas to cast their ballots.
“Elections in this country are about how to intimidate and when to do it, and a competition over resources and patronage,” said Jamil Mouawad, a lecturer in politics at the AUB.
“So when we speak of a change of mood at the student level, it doesn’t really touch on those powerful mechanisms and tools used on a national level.”
There are, however, indications that running independent in Lebanon today is a boon to candidates – and that the establishment umbrella is no longer what it used to be.
This includes the victory of an uprising-backed candidate at the influential Beirut Bar Association last year, and the fact that establishment parties are trying to style themselves as independent, notably the Lebanese Forces and the Future Movement of Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri.







Creating a real politics
During AUB’s student elections, two broad independent lists emerged: one backed by the decade-old Secular Club, another by the newly-emerged Change Starts Here (CSH).
They ended up competing against each other, while establishment-backed lists cried foul, announced boycotts and faded into the background.
The two lists had different philosophies. The Secular Club excluded anyone seen to be politically affiliated, while CSH welcomed many former supporters of establishment parties while still maintaining a progressive platform.
Malak Laza: ‘From here we go to the unions and to the national elections; it starts small and gets bigger’ [Courtesy Malak Laza/Al Jazeera]Ultimately, this accommodating approach worked in CSH’s favour: The new movement won 38 seats, almost as much as the Secular Club’s 42, despite the fact that the latter has been around for more than a decade.
For independent students best defined by what they are against – namely, against sectarian parties – these elections put a new focus on what they actually stand for.
It is a reckoning process that Mouawad, the AUB lecturer, said independent groups would also have to go through on a national level.
To some degree, it has already begun with the emergence of protest-backed groups and political parties that lean more left (such as Li-Haqqi, or “For My Right,” and Citizens in a State); centre left (such as Beirut Madinati); and others on the centre-right (such as Ana Khat Ahmar, or I Am A Red Line).
These groups aim to come together under a single nationwide opposition front in 2022, allowing for political differences to play out in the composition of lists in various districts.
According to El Kak, that is the best way to ensure independents do not siphon off votes from each other with separate campaigns, while still allowing for enough diversity to capture voters with different values.
In many cases, independent political groups will be fighting on unfamiliar ground that has not been seriously contested in the years after the end of Lebanon’s civil war in 1990 – similarly to what independent students did at RHU, a university that has been completely under the sway of the establishment since it was founded in 1999.
“Our purpose here was to challenge the ideology everyone is used to,” said Malak Laza, a 19-year-old biomedical engineering student and one of the four successful candidates at the university’s recent elections.
“We are teaching people to get used to voting and how to think about voting, and I’m learning how to work to confront the parties,” added Laza. “From here we go to the unions and to the national elections; it starts small and gets bigger.”

83,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/us-military-releases-groundbreaking-data-on-civilian-harm-report,US military releases data on civilian harm in war on ISIL,"For the first time since the US-led coalition launched a war against ISIL (ISIS) in 2014, the US military has exclusively released the geographic coordinates for nearly all confirmed instances of civilian harm and deaths in Iraq and Syria to Airwars, a UK-based non-profit organisation that works to track and assess military actions in conflict zones.
The data obtained by Airwars has allowed for the accurate locating of 341 incidents of civilian harm and roughly 1,400 civilian deaths from 2014 to 2019 that have been acknowledged by the US military.
Airwars estimates that the total number of civilians killed by US-led coalition forces during the war is somewhere in the range of 8,310 to 13,187.
The breakthrough provides insight into questions that have been looming for years. The data shows when and where a particular event took place, and simplifies the process of determining which individuals were affected by a specific attack. This new evidence could potentially open the door for formal apologies and restitution payments from the United States and its allies.
Former chief coalition spokesman Colonel Myles Caggins told Airwars that the primary reason behind the US military’s decision to release this data now was transparency.
“We take every allegation of civilian casualties with the utmost sincerity, concern, and diligence; we see the addition of the geolocations as a testament to transparency, and our commitment to working with agencies like Airwars to correctly identify civilian harm incidents.”

Major breakthrough
In response to rapid territorial gains made by the ISIL group in 2014, the US-led coalition began efforts to combat the group in August of that year. The US military supplied Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces with weapons on the ground and launched intensive air raids against the group in Iraq and Syria.
Airwars notes that the release of specific coordinates “is believed to be the most comprehensive locational civilian casualty data ever released by the US military”. Most coordinates come within 100 metres of the incident location cited by the military, while certain coordinates come as close as one metre.
Of the 344 “credible” incidents of civilian harm on record, 341 have been confirmed through this data. The remaining three were excluded by the military for various reasons such as continuing investigations and the inclusion of sensitive information.
Many of these incidents have also been confirmed through firsthand accounts such as photos and videos posted to the internet by witnesses.
Properly locating events
The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) established its civilian casualty assessment team in 2016 and began publishing reports of confirmed civilian casualties stemming from the war against ISIL on a regular basis.
The US-led coalition forces took over these assessments in December 2016, and began publishing monthly summaries of actions resulting in civilian harm. While these steps provided greater insight and transparency into adverse impacts on civilian populations, there was little information linking these events to specific geographic locations.
This posed particular challenges in areas where heavy fighting had taken place.
For example, Airwars reported extremely heavy fighting in Mosul, Iraq for the month of March 2017. The non-profit tracked five separate claims of incidents resulting in civilian harm for the day of March 14 alone. Some days saw more than a dozen claims reported. Without the specific coordinates, there was no way of separating these events from one another.

Moving forward
This location-specific data could pave a path forward for effected Iraqis and Syrians to obtain restitution from the US government and its coalition allies.
Citing a report from the Pentagon, Airwars noted that only six “ex gratia” payments were made to Iraqis in 2019, compared with over 600 payments in Afghanistan. An inability to prove the exact attack or location of an event that resulted in civilian harm posed a major obstacle to affected Iraqis and Syrians seeking to pursue claims. With the release of more specific geographic data, more claims could potentially be filed.

84,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/19/trump-has-made-no-plans-to-host-g7-summit-report,Trump has made no plans to host G7 summit: Report,"Outgoing US President Donald Trump has made no plans to host a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies after cancelling a June gathering because of the COVID-19 pandemic, three diplomatic sources told the Reuters News Agency.
The Republican president, who has refused to accept the victory of Democrat Joe Biden in the November 3 election, has not made a final decision, but time is running out to plan a major summit before he hands over power on January 20.
Three diplomatic sources said there had been no outreach by the Trump administration on dates or an agenda for a possible G7 summit. While an online meeting would still be possible, there has been no work on any kind of joint statement – a process that typically takes months, said one of the sources.
The White House declined to comment.
The United Kingdom, which assumes the rotating presidency of the G7 from the United States in January, last week congratulated President-elect Biden on his victory and invited him to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland next year, as well as a G7 summit.
Trump first cancelled plans for a June 10 in-person summit in March due to the pandemic, but later sought to revive it, only to drop the plans in May after German leader Angela Merkel said she would not attend and others expressed concerns.
In August, Trump said he was inclined to host the meeting in a “calmer atmosphere” after the presidential election, but no further action has been taken, said one of the sources.
Trump also said he would expand the invitee list to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India, dismissing the G7 as “a very outdated group of countries”.
But Trump’s push to include Russia met with a frosty reception from Germany and other allies.
Russia was expelled from what was then the G8 in 2014 after Moscow annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine. Russia still holds the territory, and various G7 governments have rebuffed previous calls from Trump to readmit Moscow.
The G7 countries are the US, the UK, France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada. The European Union also attends. The group began meeting in 1975, initially without Canada.

85,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/french-bill-makes-intimidation-on-religious-grounds-a-crime,French bill makes intimidation on religious grounds a crime,"A new French bill drafted in the aftermath of a gruesome beheading of a teacher last month makes it a crime to intimidate public servants on religious grounds.
The legislative piece, which was seen by the AFP news agency on Wednesday and will be presented before the cabinet on December 9, also makes it an offence to share the personal information of a person in a way that allows them to be identified or located by people who want to harm them.
President Emmanuel Macron’s government has clamped down on what it calls “radical Islam” following the murder of Samuel Paty, who was the target of a vicious online smear campaign for showing his students cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a class on free speech. Many Muslims believe any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
The teacher’s murder sent shockwaves through France, which has been hit by several attacks since 2015, most of them carried out by French citizens.
Paty’s name was shared online by the father of one of his students, who labelled the teacher a “thug” in a video calling for his dismissal over the cartoons.
The father also exchanged messages with Paty’s killer, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee who travelled more than 80km (50 miles) from his home in Normandy to attack the teacher in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.







Macron has promised France would “not stop drawing caricatures”, drawing severe criticism from leaders across the Muslim world and protests in a number of countries. Pakistan’s government summoned the French ambassador to register a protest against the French president’s comments.
Just weeks before Paty’s death, Macron had set out plans to tackle what he called the “Islamist separatism” in poor French neighbourhoods that aimed to create a “counter-society” where Islamic law prevailed.
‘Hands off my teacher’
The bill drafted by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti provides for each child to be given an ID number that would be used to ensure they are attending school.
“We must save our children from the clutches of the Islamists,” Darmanin told Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday.
The draft law also cracks down on online hate speech of the kind suffered by Paty by allowing for suspects to be summarily tried.
“This law is, ‘hands off my teacher, hands off the values of the republic’,” Dupond-Moretti told RTL radio.
But French human and civil rights activist Yasser Louati said he doubted the draft law was about protecting citizens, arguing instead it was more about about shielding policymakers from critique and online mobilisation against their policies.
Louati said bringing new laws is not a solution, considering that laws already exist to tackle online harassment and hate speech.
“The issue with Emmanuel Macron is every time there is a social problem, they come up with new laws,” Louati told Al Jazeera.
“I doubt they will apply it to protect the everyday citizen, let alone the everyday Muslim, or a Muslim woman who gets harassed online.”
In the wake of several assaults, France has also begun to close mosques and is cracking down on the organisations it suspects are spreading hate. However, there are fears of collective punishment and rising Islamophobia.
The new bill stipulates that any association that seeks public funding must agree to “respect the principles and values of the republic” and return the money if found to have flouted the rules.

86,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/malawi-arrests-self-proclaimed-prophet-who-fled-south-africa,Self-proclaimed ‘prophet’ hands himself over to Malawi police,"A self-proclaimed “prophet” and controversial millionaire has been arrested in Malawi after handing himself over to police following his mysterious return from South Africa, where he was on trial for fraud and money laundering charges.
The incident last week has threatened a diplomatic rift between the two southern African countries, with Pretoria reportedly furious that Shepherd Bushiri and his wife had managed to leave the country while out on bail.
“The couple is indeed in our custody. Currently, we are taking statements from the Bushiris. We will then take them to courts,” Malawi police spokesperson James Kadadzera told dpa news agency on Wednesday.
Bushiri and his wife, Mary, will remain in custody until brought before a court, according to one of their lawyers, Khumbo Soko.







Bushiri, a millionaire, said at the weekend that he had fled South Africa because he feared for his life.
“He is not a fugitive,” said Bushiri’s spokesman Ephraim Nyondo.
“He is in Malawi to seek justice, which he believes he cannot be accorded in South Africa.”
The couple were known for their lavish lifestyle in South Africa. Bushiri made his wealth through donations from followers of his Enlightened Christian Gathering church in Pretoria. He also had huge investments in the mining, telecommunications and luxury sectors.
South Africa is scrambling to establish how Bushiri escaped from the country and has initiated legal proceedings to secure his extradition.
“The Bushiri matter has been very concerning to all of us,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told local news channel ENCA.
Ramaphosa said he was expecting a “detailed report on the whole Bushiri saga … then we’ll see what action needs to be taken because it should never have happened the way it did”.
“We are going to take action, that’s for sure,” he said.

87,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/us-republicans-won-house-seats-with-new-diversity,US Republicans grow more diverse in newly won House seats,"Republicans cut the Democratic Party’s margin of majority control in half in the United States House of Representatives in the November 3 election and did it with a diverse field of women and minority candidates.
While Democrats remain in charge, Republicans have secured 207 seats in the House, up from 201 prior to the election. They will likely gain yet more as votes are still being counted in six races.
All 11 Republicans who beat incumbent Democrats so far are women or minorities. That is not the norm for a Republican Party that has long been mostly represented by white males.
As many as half of the incoming Republican freshmen class of about 40 new members will be women or minorities. They will likely double the number of women Republicans from 15 presently.
“It will be the most diverse class we have ever had,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a news conference.
“Many have already dubbed this year, the year of the Republican woman. And it couldn’t be truer from that statement. We are poised to have 29 House Republican women join our ranks, surpassing the previous record,” McCarthy told reporters.
“Every Democrat incumbent who lost, either lost to a woman, minority, or a veteran Republican,” he said.
Credit for recruitment of Republican women candidates is given to Representative Elise Stefanik, who emerged as a Republican star during the House impeachment of President Donald Trump in 2019.
Stefanik, who worked to recruit and finance women candidates in 2020, predicted in a tweet that Republican women would make even greater gains in the next election two years away.

2022 is going to be a wipeout for House Dems & America will #FirePelosi once and for all from the Speaker’s Chair.

Here is a look at Republican women and minority winners called by The Associated Press so far:
Retired National Football League player Burgess Owens, an African American man, defeated an incumbent Democrat in Utah’s 4th congressional district.
Owens was a member of the 1980 Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders football team. He is likely to be the only African American among House Republicans next year.
Two Korean-American women, Michelle Steel and Young Kim, defeated incumbent Democrats in California’s conservative stronghold of Orange County.
In California’s farm country of the San Joaquin Valley, David Valadao, whose parents are Portuguese immigrants, defeated Democratic incumbent TJ Cox.
Cherokee Nation member Yvette Herrell, a Republican state representative who allied herself with President Donald Trump on immigration and gun rights, defeated incumbent Democrat Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico’s 2nd district.
In New York City, Nicole Malliotakis, a daughter of Greek and Cuban immigrants, won election from the boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island.
Cuban immigrant Carlos Gimenez and daughter of Cuban exiles Maria Salazar, both Republicans, won against Democrats in South Florida.

88,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/18/to-concede-or-not-concede-trump-faces-defeat,"To concede, or not concede, Trump faces defeat","Democrat William Jennings Bryan started it all in 1896 with a telegram sent two days after Election Day while the votes were still being counted. They indicated that Republican William McKinley would be named the winner.
“I hasten to extend my congratulations. We have submitted the issue to the American people and their will is law,” the November 5, 1896 telegram from Bryan in Lincoln, Nebraska, to McKinley, in Canton, Ohio read.
That message kicked off the now 120-year-old tradition of a losing US presidential candidate conceding to the victor, a norm that is in danger of being shattered as President Donald Trump refuses to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect.

He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2020

The idea of acknowledging a clear electoral loss does not seem like that big of a deal. Naturally, losing hurts, and that has been reflected in concession speeches throughout the decades.
But, shortly after Bryan’s concession telegram in 1896, he explained he could not understand why conceding “was much commented upon at the time” and “why it should be considered extraordinary”.
“We were not fighting each other, but stood as the representatives of different political ideas, between which the people were to choose,” Bryan wrote in his memoirs of that campaign, “The First Battle: A Story of the Campaign of 1896”.
“A courteous observance of the proprieties of such an occasion tends to eliminate the individual and enables opponents to contend sharply over the matter of principle, without disturbance of social relations.”
The debate over principle is much larger than the individual, Bryan argued, something that was heeded – although not always smoothly – for the next 120 years.
William Jennings Bryan makes a campaign speech in Chicago in 1896; Bryan is credited with the first US presidential election concession after losing that race [File: AP Photo]And then came Donald Trump, whose entire political brand revolves around the individual and his principles. It can be argued whether that approach is toxic or laudable – 73 million Americans agreed, at least somewhat, with the latter. What cannot be argued is that it was not normal in American politics.
Breaking tradition
Trump’s norm-busting has caused non-stop steam to shoot from the ears of establishment politicians, presidential historians, journalists, and Democratic voters.
Unlike recent presidents, especially in the wake of the 1970s’ Watergate scandal, he has deliberately ignored ethics traditions and rules such as setting up a crystal clear separation from his personal business to avoid conflicts of interest, his hiring of family members to government positions, the use of government employees and federal property for campaign purposes, and the non-disclosure of income tax returns.
Unlike most politicians, Trump uses blunt – and often false or even offensive – rhetoric when discussing controversial issues, resulting in a flurry of backlash instead of constructive debate.
Unlike most presidents, he has not only been distrustful of the government bureaucracy but has outwardly and publicly tried to stymie it, whether it is criticising the US intelligence agencies or slamming government medical experts and scientists during the pandemic.
Trump critics will say that just scratches the surface of all of the norms he has shattered. His supporters – elected officials and common Americans – say this stick-it-to-the-establishment attitude is why they love him.







While we do not know what is going on in Trump’s mind, it is not hard to draw a conclusion that most, if not all, of these broken norms, including his current concession resistance, are in an effort to burnish his brand as a “winner” and a “fighter”. Whether any of those smashed guardrails will be exploited by future presidents or whether they even will have lingering detrimental effects are matters for debate.
Trump, who is reportedly considering running for another term in 2024, has signalled that his abnormal style of politics will not disappear after he leaves the White House and his behaviour will have an outsized influence on the Republican Party moving forward.
It is becoming clear that Republicans are looking at the bottom line – voter reaction – and are either outwardly sticking with the president or are carefully tiptoeing around his non-concession, reactions that are consistent with how they dealt with Trump throughout his presidency.
The reason, as it always has been, is for Republicans to avoid angering their enthusiastic base and now, post-election, to not alienate the 73 million who voted for Trump or the millions who helped House and Senate Republicans to unexpected success on Election Day.
Given those 73 million Americans voted for someone who so brazenly smashed traditions, some politicians will mimic Trump in pushing the boundaries, figuring if he could get away with it, they can too. Others will break with tradition in more subtle ways, figuring if they are not as obvious as Trump, people are unlikely to raise a fuss.
For those such as former President Barack Obama, who said in a recent interview with CBS News 60 Minutes that “hope springs eternal” regarding Trump honouring presidential transition norms, it seems as long as Trump is still in the public eye, the bar has been lowered – a bar that was set by Bryan back in 1896, one graciously recognised by then-President-elect William McKinley: “I acknowledge the receipt of your courteous message of congratulations with thanks, and beg you will receive my best wishes for your health and happiness.”

89,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/17/coronavirus-phase-3-trials-of-india-made-vaccine-begins,Coronavirus: Phase three trials of India-made vaccine begin,"Phase three trials of India’s first vaccine against COVID-19 has started in what is the largest human trials to be conducted with about 26,000 participants, Bharat Biotech announced on Monday.
The Hyderabad-based company has been developing the vaccine, Covaxin, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – India’s premier medical research body.
The first doses of the vaccine were administered to volunteers at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in Hyderabad on Monday as part of the trial which will be monitored over the next year.
Covaxin has shown promising safety and immunogenicity data in trials done during phase one and phase two, the company said.
The India trial comes a day after the US biotech firm Moderna Inc said preliminary data from a continuing phase three study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed it to be 94.5 percent effective.
India is the second-worst hit by COVID-19 with nearly 9 million cases [File: Adnan Abidi/Reuters]Last week, drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said their experimental vaccine may be 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 raising hopes for a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than one million people globally.
On November 5, a senior Indian government scientist told the Reuters news agency the Covaxin vaccine could be launched as early as February – months earlier than expected.
“The vaccine has shown good efficacy,” senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, who is also a member of its COVID-19 task force, said at the research body’s New Delhi headquarters on November 5.
“It is expected that by the beginning of next year, February or March, something would be available.”
India is the second-worst hit by COVID-19 – the disease caused by the novel coronavirus – with nearly nine million cases. On Monday, India saw less than 30,000 with number gradually declining since October.
Addressing the UN in September, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country’s vaccine production capacity would be made available globally to fight the coronavirus crisis. India is the largest producer of vaccines in the world.

The book, released on Tuesday, covers his campaign for the White House and his first term in office, during which he visited India when the now-opposition Congress party was in power.
It contains his impressions of then-Prime Minister Singh, party President Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi.
Obama describes Singh “as a chief architect of India’s economic transformation” and “a self-effacing technocrat who’d won people’s trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt.”
Obama’s praise for Singh was welcomed by senior Congress leaders like Shashi Tharoor.
Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that Obama did not name Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the book [File: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]But it is Obama’s frank and less-than-flattering description of Rahul Gandhi, the 50-year-old heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, that drew criticism from Congress party leaders.
“Rahul Gandhi has a nervous, unformed quality about him as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” quoted The New York Times from the book.
Rahul Gandhi was defeated twice by Prime Minister Modi in the 2014 and 2019 elections respectively. His grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and father, Rajiv Gandhi, both of whom were assassinated, held the post of prime minister.
‘Divisive nationalism touted by the BJP’
Congress leader Tharoor tweeted that Obama did not name Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the book that has caused a flutter in India.
“I have got hold of an advance copy of @BarackObama’s #APromisedLand & though I haven’t read every page, I did read every bit on India flagged in the Index. Big news: There isn’t much. Bigger news: in 902 pages, @narendramodi is not mentioned by name at all” (sic), Tharoor, a member of Parliament from the southern Indian state of Kerala, tweeted.
But the India portion does mention Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with Obama writing of his concern about the “divisive nationalism touted by the BJP”.
Obama described Sonia Gandhi, Rahul’s mother, as a “shrewd” person with “forceful intelligence”. Rahul Gandhi, the former US president further wrote, “seemed smart and earnest”.
Obama described Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, right, as having a ‘nervous, unformed quality’ about him [File: Altaf Hussain/Reuters]He also wrote on the future of the Congress party. “Would the baton be successfully passed to Rahul, fulfilling the destiny laid out by his mother and preserving the Congress Party’s dominance over the divisive nationalism touted by the BJP?” according to the excerpts published by thewire.in.
Rahul has been a vocal critic of Modi, attacking his government on charges of fanning religious nationalism and favouring business interests.
The last six years of Modi has seen a rise in attacks against minorities, especially Muslims, with dozens of Muslims lynched by Hindu far-right mobs. Critics say a citizenship law passed last December, which sparked nationwide protests, runs counter to the country’s secular constitution.

For nearly thirty years, every American president from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump has been reliant on administrative powers rather than fresh legislation to pursue their environmental policy goals. This reached new heights during the Barack Obama presidency, and the succeeding Trump administration has largely eviscerated all of the major Obama climate policy efforts via executive orders, regulatory revisions, and administrative stalling, designed to make it as difficult as possible for any successor to shift gears again. Even before Trump’s election, federal courts and aggressive opposition, led by state attorneys general and governors, hobbled some key Obama initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan.
So should the 46th president follow in the footsteps of his immediate four predecessors, possibly as soon as January 2021, and prepare a more far-reaching set of environmental initiatives for an early-term administrative launch, regardless of what happens on the legislative front?
There are already a dizzying array of ideas and proposals being floated for consideration by former Vice President (and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee) Joe Biden. Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement is easy but is only the start. Among numerous other options in circulation: Declare a climate emergency and reallocate resources. Block pipeline construction and restrict pipeline use. Halt drilling on federal lands and use of fracking technology across the nation. Ban all fossil fuel imports and exports. Place a carbon adjustment fee on imported goods produced through carbon-intensive processes. And on. Presto-chango through unilateral executive power that ignores the legislative branch.
As journalist Timothy Cama noted in a recent E&E News article, advocates are defaulting to strategies involving all-out executive authority as they compete for Biden’s attention. One leader of a major environmental group is quoted as saying, “We think he could actually accomplish pretty much everything you would need to really get the climate crisis under control. Don’t wait on Congress. Don’t wait to see if one type of policy solution works best; just do them all.”
This would be a very risky course of action, particularly if the goals are durable and effective policies designed to position the United States as a global climate leader rather than an erratic laggard. Any such all-out administrative strategy would generate fierce opposition from many states and interests, spanning litigation to compliance refusals. It would trigger a political backlash that could poison any potential legislative initiative regardless of post-election partisan control.
It would also face a federal judiciary not overly friendly to environmental administrative efforts undertaken by either George W. Bush or Barack Obama. Federal courts will likely be even less inclined to be supportive of such steps under a future Democratic president given Donald Trump’s having appointed at least 194 new judges. Indeed, many of the proposed executive actions would likely stick a poker into Supreme Court precedents ranging from Youngstown to Chevron, picking inter-branch and intergovernmental fights likely to be unproductive at best. All such steps would be handed over to federal agencies that have been whipsawed in the Trump era and will require infusions of new resources and talent to resume prior roles, much less adopt massive new ones.

In turn, if the goal of climate policy is sustained impact on greenhouse gas emissions rather than a short-term splash, there is the durability challenge. Recent presidencies suggest that at least two consecutive terms are essential to have a credible chance to launch and sustain executive-based policies, with a third highly preferable (Reagan-to-George H.W. Bush) and a fourth optimal (Roosevelt-to-Truman). Much of the Obama administrative presidency was based on an implicit assumption of a hand-off to an allied successor who would finish the job, putting prior efforts into operation and building upon them. The 2016 election was yet another reminder that long-term party presidential runs are rare. We continue to see a similar pattern in many states, where unilateral gubernatorial actions often sound promising initially but accomplish stunningly little after one or two terms.
Finally, such a strategy would indicate a willingness to approach presidential powers with the same sense of abandon, albeit with fundamentally different policy goals, as Donald Trump. It would suggest a political reality that presumes Congress cannot be a consequential or credible policy player, further hastening a shift toward an increasingly formidable federal executive checked only by courts and states in hostile opposition.
In recent years, I have been studying, with colleagues Frank Thompson and Kenneth Wong, the evolution of presidential power in domestic policy for a new book that will be published by Brookings Press come September. This book will examine the growing penchant for expanding executive authority in multiple areas of federal policy, including climate change, as well as the increasingly prominent role of well-organized states to lead opposition in litigation and implementation, all with a focus on the Obama-to-Trump era.
In the case of climate change, there are ways that administrative powers can and should be used, particularly when policies have a firm constitutional foundation and can build effectively through adaptive mechanisms provided by established legislation. This would include some sections of the Clean Air Act that are tailor-made for such modifications as scientific understanding of risks advances. But there are sobering political and legal limits on what this approach can accomplish. If the United States is to finally move toward a climate policy regime that can prove to be enduring, effective domestically, and consequential globally, Congress must engage constructively.
Any policy route that runs through Congress is daunting but an election is coming and new opportunities may emerge. One consideration is whether there is any future legislative path that involves members of both parties in a hyperpartisan setting where Republicans have routinely blocked climate policy legislation at federal and state levels for the past decade. Current congressional deliberations over separate bills that would phase out hydrofluorocarbons and provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund have continued to move forward with broad bipartisan support in recent months. This is evident even in the Senate, which overwhelmingly approved the latter proposal on June 17. Each could plausibly be approved this year. Neither case would approach the scope of a far-reaching climate bill but both can inform future legislative strategies. They will offer insight into whether any form of legislative bipartisanship is politically feasible on climate change or if instead a purely partisan path is the lone game in town.

In the fight to combat the climate crisis, the years 2020, 2030, and 2050 will be important ones for humanity. Under the Paris Agreement, ratified in 2016, 196 states and the European Union have agreed to keep the rise in global temperatures this century to well below 2°C higher than pre-industrial levels, and to take all measures to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. Such a goal aims to divert the devastating effects that unchecked global warming will have not only on human society but also on the planet—from the loss of human life and destruction of infrastructure due to rising sea levels, more frequent heat waves, and intensified storms, forest fires, and droughts; to widespread extinction of plant and animal species and the collapse of entire ecosystems.

In order to achieve the goals set forward by the Paris Agreement, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that countries must achieve the target of net-zero anthropogenic carbon emissions—those caused by human activity—by the year 2050. To reach this benchmark, global emissions must fall by at least 45 percent from 2010 levels by the year 2030. In 2015, countries submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), or their national strategies to reduce emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. However, analysis suggests that the collective efforts behind these NDCs will lead us to fall well short of the Paris goals. Stakeholders committed to the success of the Paris Agreement—and the survival of human civilization—are now focusing on the year 2020, when countries have the opportunity to communicate new or updated NDCs.
It is in this context that the present analysis of NDCs emerges. NDCs—in both their aspiration and implementation—are essential for ensuring that global efforts lead to net-zero emissions by 2050. It is imperative that they include the most comprehensive and inclusive mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as adaptation efforts, which attempt to adjust human and natural systems in response to actual or expected climate impacts in an endeavor to moderate or avoid harm. This means not only addressing the technical sources of carbon emissions or the development of low-carbon technology and renewable energy, but also the sociological factors like poverty, gender inequality, the denial of human rights, and low quality of education that contribute to the systemic drivers of climate change. It also means ensuring NDCs address the multifold pathways for increasing intergenerational human (and non-human) resilience and adaptive capacity.
Why girls’ education
Women and girls experience heightened social, economic, and health impacts of climate change, both in the context of slow-onset disasters like droughts or weather-related emergencies brought on by floods, storms, and heatwaves. Not only does evidence suggest that women’s mortality rates are higher than men’s during climate-related disasters, women are also more likely to experience human rights abuses including: human trafficking as well as sexual violence in temporary shelters; disruptions in their access to important health services including family planning or maternal and postnatal care; interruptions in their participation in income-generating activities due to their role in post-disaster clean-up and recovery; and reductions in their intra-household bargaining power; among many other documented impacts on their well-being.
When age is added to considerations of gender—that is, if the focus is specifically on girls—there is another layer of vulnerability and impact through which climate change intersects. For instance, adolescent girls are at additional risk of being pulled out of school to help alleviate extra domestic burdens, like fetching water, that are shouldered by women in households under climate-related stress. Leaving school also makes girls less likely to be informed about climate change and further increases their vulnerability. Girls are also at risk of being married off early in an attempt by households to manage the financial burdens and/or female safety concerns borne by the environmental hardships and aftermath of weather-related disasters. Such circumstances put into play the early onset of key life transitions, including early pregnancy, that direct girls into a vicious cycle of intergenerational poverty, vulnerability, and marginalization.
National policies that address climate change must also address sociological issues like gender inequality through greater attention to quality, empowering, and transformative education for girls. Climate strategies that are “gender-blind”—or, that do not take gender into consideration—can inadvertently exacerbate gender inequality. By contrast, climate action that is gender-sensitive, gender-responsive, and gender-transformative can bring about the systems-level change needed, not only to eliminate gender inequality, but also to achieve a sustainable, just, equitable, and fair human society.

This paper attempts to illuminate how countries are doing with regard to such climate strategies—promoting education, protection, and empowerment—by focusing on two key questions:

Recognizing how gender and age place girls at a double disadvantage when it comes to populations with heightened vulnerability to climate change, do climate strategies include adequate attention to social protection, and the inclusion and empowerment of these vulnerable groups?
Recognizing how education, specifically of girls, and the achievement of gender equality more broadly, contribute in powerful ways to humanity’s ability to reverse climate catastrophe, do climate strategies include sufficient attention to girls’ education, specifically, and to inclusive, quality, gender-transformative education, more broadly?

Our analysis will provide a baseline from which we can track progress in national policies to combat climate change on the crucial issues of gender equality, girls’ education, and the empowerment of marginalized groups.

“We don’t really worry about climate change because it’s too overwhelming and we’re already in too deep. It’s like if you owe your bookie $1,000, you’re like, ‘OK, I’ve got to pay this dude back.’ But if you owe your bookie $1 million dollars, you’re like, ‘I guess I’m just going to die.’”
⁠— Colin Jost, Saturday Night Live, 10/13/18
The above quote is from a Saturday Night Live skit on the weekend following release of a report from the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report was one of the most dramatic ones yet, predicting that some of the most severe social and economic damage from the rise in global temperatures could come as soon at 2040. And yet, two comedians, Colin Jost and Michael Che, summed up the difficult (and perhaps impossible) politics of the issue in less than three minutes. You don’t have to be a climate denier to be, in the end, indifferent to the issue.

As the climate crisis becomes more serious and more obvious, Americans remain resistant to decisive and comprehensive action on climate change. In “The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming,” David Wallace-Wells paints a frightening picture of the coming environmental apocalypse. Whole parts of the globe will become too hot for human habitation and those left behind will die of heat. Diseases will increase and mutate. Food shortages will become chronic as we fail to move agriculture from one climate to another. Whole countries like Bangladesh and parts of other countries like Miami will be underwater. Shortages of fresh water will affect humans and agriculture. The oceans will die, the air will get dirtier. “But,” as Wallace-Wells argues, “what lies between us and extinction is horrifying enough.”1 That’s because, as climate change takes its toll on Earth’s physical planet, it will also cause social, economic, and political chaos as refugees flee areas that can no longer sustain them. If this prediction seems a bit extreme, all we have to do is look at recent weather events that keep breaking records to confront the possibility that the threat from climate change may indeed be existential.
public opinion on the climate crisis
Yet, in spite of the evidence at hand, climate change remains the toughest, most intractable political issue we, as a society, have ever faced. This is not to say that there hasn’t been progress. In the United States, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions has held steady since 1990–even though our economy and our population has grown.2 But globally, greenhouse gases have increased since then, bringing humanity very close to the dangerous levels of global warming that were predicted.3 As scientific evidence about the causes of climate change has mounted and as a consensus has evolved in the scientific community, the public has remained divided and large, important parts of the political class have been indifferent. For instance, although 2017 was a year of 16 different billion-dollar natural disasters,4 according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the percentage of voters who were “very concerned” about climate change stayed within the 40% range–where it has been rather stubbornly stuck for the past two years.5 The following chart shows Gallup public opinion polling for the past two decades.6 During this period, but especially in the most recent decade, about a third to almost half of the public believes that the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated.

			window.__simplechart_public_path__ = window.__simplechart_public_path__ ||
				""https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/wp-content\/plugins\/wordpress-simplechart\/js\/app\/"";
		}
	
Dramatic and unprecedented natural disasters have had little effect on the public. Following blizzards and an unusually frigid winter in 2015, only 37% of Americans said climate change would pose a serious threat to them in their lifetimes.7 After Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in 2017, concern about climate change increased by 7 points among Republicans and 2 points among Democrats.8 But in the next year, an August 2018 poll taken shortly after the California wildfires showed concern among Republicans down to 44% and up to 79% among Democrats.9 In a YouGov poll in the summer of 2019—during record heat waves in the U.S. and Europe—only 42% of the public said that they were very concerned and only 22% of Republicans said that they were” very concerned about climate change.”10
If natural disasters don’t affect attitudes toward climate change, partisanship does. The following chart from Pew Research shows the gulf that exists between Democrats and Republicans on this issue.11
Source: Pew Research Center.
The partisan divide began in the late 1990s and has increased over time. In 1997, nearly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans said that the effects of global warming have already begun. Ten years later, the gap was 34%: 76% of Democrats said the effects had already begun, and only 42% of Republicans agreed.

Republican resistance on this issue is one but not the only reason why, in the face of mounting evidence, the public remains lukewarm on this existential issue. The dire warnings, the scientific consensus, and the death toll from unprecedented climate events have failed to move the public very much. For two years now, the number of Americans who say they are “very concerned” about climate change fails to reach 50%, as a look at polling from Quinnipiac illustrates.12

An even more telling piece of evidence on public indifference to climate change comes from 30 years of open-ended polling conducted by Gallup. Open-ended polling is especially interesting since it elicits an unprompted response from the individual. Between 1989 and 2019, Gallup has asked “What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?” Jobs, the economy, and health care are often at the top of the list. “Environment/pollution” is not often mentioned. In fact, over a 30-year period, it was mentioned by anywhere from less than 0.5% to 8% of the public. In the most recent 2019 poll (August), “the government/poor leadership” was mentioned by 22% of the public, and “immigration” by 18%. “Environment/pollution/climate change” garnered only 3% of the public. And in some earlier polls, climate change is not even mentioned by a significant portion of the public (although people could be including that within the term environment.)13
Why can’t we get our heads around this?
Given the severity of the climate crisis and the potential for existential damage to the human race and planet, the lack of intensity around the issue is simultaneously incomprehensible and totally understandable. So let’s look at the latter. The explanations fall into at least four categories: complexity; jurisdiction and accountability; collective action and trust; and imagination.
Complexity
Complexity is the death knell of many modern public policy problems and solutions. And complexity is inherent in climate change. The causes of global warming are varied, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. As the climate warms, it affects glaciers, sea levels, water supply, rainfall, evaporation, wind, and a host of other natural phenomenon that affect weather patterns. Unlike an earlier generation of environmental problems, it is hard to see the connections between coal plants in one part of the world and hurricanes in another. In contrast, when the water in your river smells and turns a disgusting color and dead fish float on top of it, no sophisticated scientific training is required to understand the link between what’s happening in the river and the chemical plant dumping things into it. The first generation of the environmental movement had an easier time making the connection between cause and effect.
Evidence for this comes from approximately three decades of polling on the environment by Gallup. In the chart below, most of the polls took place between 1989 and 2019.14 Note that, over time, the most worrisome environmental problems are visible pollution problems. Water, soil, and ocean and beach pollution are at the top. These are things average people can see and smell. Global warming or climate change is toward the bottom. These numbers change somewhat over time and understandably so, which is why data is included from 2019 where available. People are more worried about climate change than they used to be. Nonetheless, the complexity of the issue compared to the more straightforward cause-and-effect characteristics of other environmental issues is a major impediment to political action.

When former Vice President Al Gore was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the prize was for “their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change.” Through his books, his famous slide show, and his 2006 movie, “An Inconvenient Truth,” Gore made it his mission to explain the scientific processes that make global warming so dangerous. But the inherent complexity of cause and effect in climate change makes it a topic in need of continuous education.
Jurisdiction and accountability
The second major impediment to political action stems from problems of jurisdiction and accountability. From the beginning, modern government has relied upon the concept of jurisdiction–“territory within which a court or government agency may properly exercise its power.”15 And implicit in the concept of jurisdiction is geography. But two of the stickiest problems of the 21st century–climate change and cybersecurity–are challenging because it is so difficult to nail down jurisdiction. When we are able to establish jurisdiction we are able to establish rules, laws, and accountability for adherence to the law–the three bedrock principles of modern democratic governance. In the absence of jurisdiction, everyone is accountable and therefore no one is accountable.

Environmental Policy: The Next Generation

When a cybercrime or cyberattack occurs, we have trouble with jurisdiction. If the perpetrator of a cyberattack on an electrical grid is a Russian living in Tirana, Albania, who routes attacks through France and Canada, who can prosecute the individual? (Assuming, that is, that we can even find them.) Similarly, if coal plants in China and cattle ranching in Australia increase their outputs of greenhouse gases in one year and there are droughts in Africa and floods in Europe the next, who is responsible?
We currently attribute greenhouse gas emissions to individual countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we attribute greenhouse gases to their sources within the United States via the Environmental Protections Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. But attribution without enforcement mechanisms is only half the battle–if that. Nationally and internationally there is no legal architecture that allows us to reward and/or punish those who decrease or increase their greenhouse gas emissions. Even the Paris Agreement–which President Trump pulled the U.S. out of–is only a set of pledges from individual countries. Measurement is a first step toward accountability, and measurement needs constant improvement. But measurement in the absence of accountability is meaningless, especially in situations where many people are skeptical of cause and effect.
The Toxic Release Inventory was established by Congress in 1982 as an amendment to the Superfund Bill. Over the years, the steady flow of information about the release of hazardous chemicals into the environment has had many positive effects on regulators, environmentalists, and industrialists.16 Studies have shown that “facilities reduce emissions by an additional 4.28% on average, and their use of source reduction increases by 3.07% on average when the relative assessed hazard level of a chemical increases compared to when it decreases.”17
But the Toxic Release Inventory has one advantage that the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program does not. The effects of dangerous chemicals on a population are generally fairly clear and obvious: dirty water, dirty air, difficulty breathing, unusual rates of cancer, etc. The cause and effect is often undeniable as the many lawyers who have represented communities and won their cases against large polluters can attest. Greenhouse gas emissions affect people thousands of miles away from their source and make it easier to believe that it wasn’t the fossil fuels at all, just the weather pattern or an act of God. Hence, the linkage between jurisdiction and accountability is weak.
Collective action and trust
Our increasingly hot summers drive the demand for air conditioning. However, air conditioning adds to the heat outside. Scientists estimate that under a realistic set of circumstances, “waste heat from air conditioners exacerbated the heat island effect, the phenomenon in which densely packed cities experience higher temperatures than similarly situated rural areas.”18 Air conditioning could add as much as 1 degree Celsius (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) to the heat of a city. Which one of us, however, would voluntarily turn off their air conditioning knowing full well that hundreds of thousands of other “free riders” would not?
 “It is the lack of trust in government that may be one of the foundational barriers to effective environmental action.”
This is just one simplified version of the collective action problem. People may understand that they should act in a certain way for the greater good, but as individuals, they are loathe to turn off their air conditioning or stop flying places for vacations—knowing that others will not be joining them. This is why government is the most frequent solution to collective action problems. Combating climate change requires collective action on many fronts, and it requires collective action both nationally and internationally. But this is extremely difficult in democracies like the U.S., which face strong individualist traditions in the culture along with a lack of trust in government.
In fact, it is the lack of trust in government that may be one of the foundational barriers to effective environmental action. Writing in the journal Global Environmental Change, E. Keith Smith and Adam Mayer looked at 35 different countries. They found that a lack of trust in institutions blunts the public’s risk perceptions and therefore their willingness to support behaviors or policies to address climate change.19
Their findings make intuitive sense especially in the American context. If you are skeptical about government in general, you are skeptical about your government telling you that you need to do something about climate change; you are even more skeptical about an international body like the United Nations telling you that climate change is a very serious problem. Below is a graph showing the moving average over time of Americans who say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right “just about always” or “most of the time.”20
Source: Pew Research Center.
Imagination
The final piece to the puzzle of why the political salience of climate change seems so out of step with the physical proof and urgency of the issue may have to do with the realm of imagination. As every journalist knows, it is important to be able to tell a story, and as every teacher knows, we learn best through stories. And novelists and screenwriters are the most effective and powerful storytellers we have in society. And yet, in an intriguing book called “The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable,” the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh writes that climate change is even more absent in the world of fiction than it is in nonfiction.
To see that this is so, we need only glance through the pages of a few highly regarded literary journals and book reviews, for example, the London Review of books, the New York Review of Books, the Los Angeles Review of Books, the Literary Journal, and the New York Times Review of Books. When the subject of climate change occurs in these publications, it is almost always in relation to nonfiction; novels and short stories are very rarely to be glimpsed within this horizon. Indeed, it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by serious literary journals: the mere mention of the subject is often enough to relegate a noel or short story to the genre of science fiction.21
The absence of climate change from novels means that it is also absent from movies and television–the great powerful purveyors of stories in our time. One can’t underestimate the power of fiction in shaping society’s attitudes. Some older Americans can remember how the 1958 novel “Exodus,” by Leon Uris, and the subsequent 1960 movie by the same name impacted a generation of non-Jewish Americans to be supportive of Israel. Or how the 2000 movie “Erin Brockovich,” based on a true story of a young woman who takes on an energy corporation, helped popularize the environmental justice movement.
Ghosh’s contribution to our understanding of this issue is not so much in his sections on politics as it is on his insight that fiction in our age is unable to deal with events that are so improbable and so removed from the agency of the individual that they cannot be written about in any realistic way.
All of which brings us back to our two Saturday Night Live comedians.
Conclusion
We have trouble imagining the potential devastation of climate change. We have trouble trusting governments to lead us into much needed collective action. We have trouble defining the links between jurisdiction and accountability. And we have trouble understanding the causality in the first place.
How can we fix this? And can we fix this in time to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change?
Some people, recognizing the political problem, hope for a technological fix such as carbon capture or some other geoengineering fix. The problem with technological fixes is that they are remote and may very well not be effective in time to stave off massive amounts of social and economic disruption. On the other hand, early-1950s America faced what seemed to be an endlessly heartbreaking polio epidemic; in less than a decade, however, a vaccine was developed and the epidemic ended. Given the technological miracles seen in our lifetime, we should not dismiss a technological solution, and we should invest heavily in one with both public and private dollars.
A second imperative is to increase basic scientific literacy so that the burden of pedagogy does not fall on folks like Al Gore alone. Some of this is already happening with the attention given to STEM training in education. But it is clear that climate change is only one of many complex scientific issues that average citizens will be called upon to understand and act on in the future. A renewed focus on scientific literacy may need to be implemented throughout America’s schools.
Which brings us to the storytellers. Just as Al Gore won an Emmy for a movie on climate change, the creative elements in our society need to help explain what’s at stake. They will find a receptive audience in the younger generation. As evidenced by their activism on this issue—this past week, millions marched in countries around the world to protest inaction around climate change—young people are especially concerned with the environment.22 The millennial generation is a very large one, and they have so far shown themselves to be civic minded and environmentally engaged.
“Awareness without the ability to hold corporations, countries, and individuals accountable will not result in major action on environmental issues. But measurement and accountability without an understanding of the connections between a warmer planet and dangerous climate changes will not result in major action either.”
A third imperative is to strengthen the link between jurisdiction and accountability. Nationally and internationally, we need to be able to reward and punish private and public actors for their environmental actions. The condemnation of Brazil’s government for deforestation and fires in the Amazon was largely without consequences. Until there are penalties for things like greenhouse gas emissions, they will not be reduced in sufficient amounts.
Because this issue poses the ultimate collective action problem, it requires governmental action, such as treaties, taxes, and regulations, for starters. But very few citizens in our country are going to support governmental action without first trusting government to get it right. We need to restore trust in government. It has been on a steady downward slide since the George W. Bush administration. Unless we restore trust in government, we are not likely to achieve significant collective action.
Of course, all these things must proceed hand in hand. Awareness without the ability to hold corporations, countries, and individuals accountable will not result in major action on environmental issues. But measurement and accountability without an understanding of the connections between a warmer planet and dangerous climate changes will not result in major action either. Above all, we need to restore—through government and other means—our trust in collective action.

Organizations, news outlets, and activists are focused on increasing attention to the growing climate crisis. On September 23, the United Nations Climate Action Summit happens in New York, part of the UN General Assembly meeting. In this edition of Charts of the Week, a look at some research related to energy and climate.
Coal declining, natural gas rising as US electricity sources 
In a report titled, “The Risk of Fiscal Collapse in Coal-Reliant Communities,” expert authors from Brookings and the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University examine risks to the 53,000 U.S. workers and their communities employed in the coal industry. As they show, over 80% of U.S.-coal was used in electricity generation, but the share of overall electricity generated from coal is steadily declining. 

COAL DOMINATES INDIA’S POWER SUPPLY
Coal remains the dominant source of electricity power generation in India. Rahul Tongia and Samantha Gross write that “Despite expected growth in RE [renewable energy], we project that coal will remain the dominant fuel for electricity generation in India through 2030 and beyond, even though its share of generation will fall.” In their paper, the authors examine India’s use of coal, and its aims to increase alternative sources of energy to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.
 
US CLIMATE COSTS WILL BE WIDESPREAD BUT UNEVEN BY CENTURY’S END 
A team of Brookings researchers examine the geography of climate change with the help of county-level data from the Climate Impact Lab. The data include assessments of climate-change impact in various areas, including agriculture, mortality, coastal damage, and labor supply risk. The chart below aggregates these factors. The researchers conclude, among other things, that mortality represents the largest cause of the variability, and also climate change could “bestow net economic benefits” to some areas of the country.

Highly destructive floods, storms, heatwaves, and droughts have become the new climate norm. The massive rainfall that has wreaked havoc in Sri Lanka and India’s record-breaking heatwave melting urban tarmac are just two of the latest examples of the spike in climate-related natural hazards. It is in this context of rising danger that the Trump administration’s decision to ditch the Paris Agreement on climate changes proves irresponsible.

To be sure, local conditions are aggravating factors—deforestation, land degradation, population pressures, and deficits in disaster management—and they need careful attention. But make no mistake, global warming is exacerbating changes in temperatures and precipitation, making countries more disaster-prone than ever.
Rising climate-related disasters is a global phenomenon (Figure 1). Earlier this year in Colombia, heavy rains overnight caused rivers to burst their banks, taking over 200 lives. In Quebec, Canada, excessive rainfall flooded thousands of homes. But poorer countries, especially in Asia, are bearing the largest brunt. In Sri Lanka’s latest floods, the worst since 2003, some places experienced more rain in a day than the usual for a year. Landslides are becoming common in many parts of Asia during the monsoon season because uplands have been stripped of forest cover to clear land for export crops.
Figure 1: Increasing frequency of floods and storms, 1960-2015

Locally, disaster risks are increasing because more people are exposed. Higher population densities across developing Asia mean that more people are moving into flood-prone areas. Unregulated urbanization and poor drainage and flood protection are dangerously raising the stakes. The effect of the severe monsoon floods of 2015 in Chennai, India, were made worse by uncontrolled construction over natural flood discharge channels.
Wrong decisions in disaster flood management can be disastrous. Thailand’s 2011 floods—which submerged economic heartlands and caused losses amounting to 13 percent of GDP—were aggravated by the misjudged release of water from dams. During the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand, India, the debris from dam construction upstream blocked rivers, augmenting the overflow.
While scientists are careful not to link any single flood or storm to climate change, the connection of these events to global warming is unmistakable (Figure 2). Global data over the past 50 years show that the incidence of floods and storms is linked to not only population density and people’s vulnerability to hazards but also to greenhouse gas emissions.
Figure 2: Carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations at Mauna Loa and global annual temperature anomaly: 1959–2014

So, disaster prevention must become a bigger priority to protect human and physical capital and probably needs to be 1–2 percent of national budgets. A stark example of this under-resourced investment is that for every $100 of official development assistance, only $0.40 go to disaster risk reduction. Yet acting on disaster prevention makes good economic sense. New York’s disaster preparedness and prevention efforts after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 boosted confidence among investors and businesses, leveraged private investments, and helped stimulate growth.
A neglected aspect is making hospitals, emergency shelters, and other vital installations more disaster resistant and ensuring functioning lifelines—notably potable water, first aid, and power supplies—during disasters. Readiness also involves care in zoning regulations and building codes to protect businesses, homes, and neighborhoods. This is essential as floods can disrupt supply chains and information networks, as we have seen in Sri Lanka, Chennai, and Thailand.
But local action will be futile without global action, and the 2015 Paris Agreement among 195 nations is critical. Vast differences exist in emissions from countries. China is the largest emitter in the aggregate, while the United States is way ahead in per capita terms. Many will need technological and financial support in adapting to climate change. To this end, a $100-billion financing plan to support climate adaptation and mitigation is a key component of the Paris Agreement.

Trump’s Paris Agreement withdrawal: What it means and what comes next

The Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the agreement flies in the face of all this reality. (The only other two non-participants are Syria, who is in a civil war, and Nicaragua, who actually wanted a stronger agreement). The decision is against the U.S.’s own economic and geopolitical interests. It also shirks responsibility for the country’s share of the carbon footprint driving everyone’s fortunes.
Sri Lanka’s floods and India’s heatwaves are stark reminders of the needed priority for disaster resilience in national programs. But for these programs to have any chance of success, climate mitigation, especially by the biggest emitters, must take center stage.

Climate change is probably the biggest threat facing humanity today. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world must cut its carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050 in order to prevent global warming of 1.5°C, or likely more, above pre-industrial levels in this century. The challenge calls for drastic immediate action, because the infrastructure investments the world makes today will determine the carbon intensity of its growth path for decades.

Yet despite widespread recognition of the size and urgency of the climate challenge, emissions continue to increase, land is “under growing human pressure,” and the Amazon has never been more threatened.
Much of the early climate debate revolved around whether the world should take drastic immediate action to mitigate global warming, or adopt a more gradual approach. The gradualists argued with some success that drastic immediate measures would impose heavy short-term economic costs.
But three recent developments have altered the course of the debate. First, the various feedback loops triggered by global warming now threaten to cause greater and more imminent damage than previously thought.
Second, the cost of clean energy has declined much faster than previously assumed. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewable-energy sources are already the cheapest power option in much of the world, with solar and wind technologies leading the way. Moreover, the cost of “greening” could fall even faster in the future through learning-by-doing. This is also likely to be the case in urban design, transportation, agriculture, and forest protection, all of which need to undergo a green transition.
Finally, the immediate negative externalities of the world’s current high-carbon growth model, such as air pollution, are now better recognized as adding to the short-term cost of climate change. Reducing them would therefore partially offset the up-front cost of mitigation.
These shifts greatly strengthen the case for pursuing much faster and bolder forms of mitigation. As the 2014 New Climate Economy Report concluded, there need not be a trade-off between growth and forceful climate action, even in the short term.
So, why is more not being done? For starters, although the green transition may have a small net aggregate cost, it is certain to generate losers (as well as winners). And as is often the case with such transitions (for example with trade liberalization), the gains will be spread across large parts of the population, while the losses will be more concentrated on specific groups, making them more visible and politically disruptive.
When advocating policies that result in aggregate welfare gains, economists often fail to give enough consideration to their likely distributional impact. Instead, they often implicitly assume that the winners will compensate the losers. But if such compensation does not actually occur, the losers are left worse off and can often block change, as the “yellow vest” protesters (gilets jaunes) have done since 2018, when the French government proposed a new climate-friendly fuel tax.

The climate crisis, migration, and refugees

The de facto coalition that is currently resisting climate action consists of the vested interests that own carbon-intensive assets (such as oil companies) and the mostly lower-income groups that would be short-term losers in a rapid transition. Compensating the latter and isolating the former is politically essential.
Unfortunately, it is not clear whether, say, the young German urbanites who voted for the Greens in the European Parliament elections this year would happily compensate the older auto workers—let alone Polish coal miners—who would suffer in a rapid transition. And complicating matters further, the groups at risk of short-term losses from green policies are often bearing the brunt of digitization and globalization, too.
Another hurdle to bold action is that climate protection constitutes an “additive” global public good, because there is only one atmosphere and the emissions of any one country add to global greenhouse-gas concentrations as much as those of any other country. This causes the free-rider problem of “carbon leakage.” Europe may well reduce its emissions in line with (or even beyond) the aims of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, but if India and China’s emissions keep increasing—or if Brazil allows the Amazon to collapse—those efforts will have been futile.
Clearly, the whole world would benefit from a cooperative solution. But without a binding international agreement or a supranational authority that can impose global green policies, few countries have an incentive to engage in sufficient mitigation efforts—leaving everyone worse off.
One possible measure to deter free riding is a carbon border tax, as recently proposed by the incoming president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Governments that tax carbon could levy a border tax equal to the implicit subsidy given to their “dirty” exports by governments who do not have such a tax. This would effectively impose a kind of shadow carbon price on free riders, prompting them to produce fewer carbon-intensive goods.
Provided that it is nondiscriminatory, such border pricing would enhance global welfare and be compatible with World Trade Organization rules. But calculating the appropriate tax would be very difficult in practice. It would, for example, necessitate calculating the tax equivalent of regulatory ceilings. The measure may also invite countries like the United States to retaliate with distortive measures, making it somewhat perilous. Moreover, the tax would likely have regressive distributional consequences, hurting poor countries the most. A better strategy, then, is to increase green investment in developing countries substantially, with multilateral development banks catalyzing private financing in addition to their own funds.
Distributional issues—not aggregate costs—are the real obstacle to the ambitious policies needed to avert possibly catastrophic climate change. Similar challenges, at both the national and international levels, also affect the transitions entailed by the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Neo-nationalist populists are already feeding on the fears created by disruptive change. Ambitious decarbonization could further fan these flames if it is not accompanied by social policies that effectively ease the process. Progressives everywhere must therefore unite in support not only of a rapid green transition, but of one that is politically feasible and desirable for the vast majority of citizens—even in the short run.

Energy and climate expert Brookings Nonresident Senior Fellow David G. Victor, writing together with economist Danny Cullenward, has co-authored a new book, “Making Climate Policy Work,” publishing through Polity Press.
The pair analyze the reasons why widely promoted market mechanisms for addressing climate change have largely failed in practical application, exploring why these approaches haven’t achieved the results analysts once predicted. The authors argue the problems are largely structural, and, despite beneficial characteristics such as transparency and flexibility, that much of the real ‘work’ is being done through regulatory and industrial policy instruments.  Rooted in empirical cases, Victor and Cullenward offer a “simple model of politics” to help explain the interest groups and institutions through which they operate, concluding that sectoral politics matter significantly, and arguing for some non-intuitive reforms.

On March 14, 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the southeast coast of Mozambique. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 1.85 million people needed assistance. 146,000 people were internally displaced, and Mozambique scrambled to house them in 155 temporary sites.1 The cyclone and subsequent flooding damaged 100,000 homes, destroyed 1 million acres of crops, and demolished $1 billion worth of infrastructure.2

One historic storm in one place over the course of one day. While Cyclone Idai was the worst storm in Mozambique’s history, the world is looking towards a future where these “unprecedented” storms are commonplace. This global challenge has and will continue to create a multitude of critical issues that the international community must confront, including:

Large-scale human migration due to resource scarcity, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and other factors, particularly in the developing countries in the earth’s low latitudinal band
Intensifying intra- and inter-state competition for food, water, and other resources, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa
Increased frequency and severity of disease outbreaks
Increased U.S. border stress due to the severe effects of climate change in parts of Central America

All of these challenges are serious, but the scope and scale of human migration due to climate change will test the limits of national and global governance as well as international cooperation.
The migration-climate nexus is real, but more scrutiny and action are required
In 2018, the World Bank estimated that three regions (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia) will generate 143 million more climate migrants by 2050.3 In 2017, 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced, more than at any point in human history. While it is difficult to estimate, approximately one-third of these (22.5 million4 to 24 million5 people) were forced to move by “sudden onset” weather events—flooding, forest fires after droughts, and intensified storms. While the remaining two-thirds of displacements are the results of other humanitarian crises, it is becoming obvious that climate change is contributing to so-called slow onset events such as desertification, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, air pollution, rain pattern shifts and loss of biodiversity.6 This deterioration will exacerbate many humanitarian crises and may lead to more people being on the move.
Multilateral institutions, development agencies, and international law must do far more to thoroughly examine the challenges of climate change (early efforts, like the World Bank’s 2010 World Development Report on climate change,7 had little uptake at a time when few thought a climate crisis was around the corner). Moreover, neither a multilateral strategy nor a legal framework exist to account for climate change as a driver of migration. Whether in terms of limited access to clean water, food scarcity, agricultural degradation, or violent conflict,8 climate change will intensify these challenges and be a significant push factor in human migration patterns.
To date, there are only a few cases where climate change is the sole factor prompting migration. The clearest examples are in the Pacific Islands. The sea level is rising at a rate of 12 millimeters per year in the western Pacific and has already submerged eight islands. Two more are on the brink of disappearing, prompting a wave of migration to larger countries.910 By 2100, it is estimated that 48 islands overall will be lost to the rising ocean.11 In 2015, the Teitota family applied for refugee status in New Zealand, fleeing the disappearing island nation of Kiribati.12 Their case, the first request for refuge explicitly attributed climate change, made it to the High Court of New Zealand but was ultimately dismissed. Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia have drastically reduced in size, washed down to an uninhabitable state, had their fresh water contaminated by the inflow of seawater, and disappeared in the past decade.13 Despite their extreme vulnerability, the relatively small population (2.3 million people spread across 11 countries14) and remote location of the Pacific Islands means that they garner little international action, for all the attention they receive in the media.

Although there are few instances of climate change as the sole factor in migration, climate change is widely recognized as a contributing and exacerbating factor in migration and in conflict.
In South Asia, increasing temperatures, sea level rise, more frequent cyclones, flooding of river systems fed by melting glaciers, and other extreme weather events are exacerbating current internal and international migration patterns. Additionally, rapid economic growth and urbanization are accelerating and magnifying the impact and drivers of climate change—the demand for energy is expected to grow 66 percent by 2040.15 Compounding this, many of the expanding urban areas are located in low-lying coastal areas, already threatened by sea level rise.16 The confluence of these factors leads the World Bank to predict that the collective South Asian economy (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) will lose 1.8 percent of its annual GDP due to climate change by 2050.17 The New York Times reports that the living conditions of 800 million people could seriously diminish.18 Diminishing living conditions on this scale and intensity will prompt mass migration—possibly at an unprecedented level.
Northwest Africa is facing rising sea levels, drought, and desertification. These conditions will only add to the already substantial number of seasonal migrants and put added strain on the country of origin, as well as on destination countries and the routes migrants travel. The destabilizing effects of climate change should be of great concern to all those who seek security and stability in the region. Climate and security experts often cite the impacts of the extreme drought in Syria that preceded the 2011 civil war.19 The security community also highlights the connection between climate change and terrorism—for instance, the decline of agricultural and pastoral livelihoods has been linked to the effectiveness of financial recruiting strategies by al-Qaida.20
The intersection of climate change and migration requires new, nimble, and comprehensive solutions to the multidimensional challenges it creates. Accordingly, the signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change requested that the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change (WIM) develop recommendations for addressing people displaced by climate change.21 Similarly, The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (adopted by 164 countries—not including the U.S.—in Marrakech in December 2018) called on countries to make plans to prevent the need for climate-caused relocation and support those forced to relocate.22 However, these agreements are neither legally binding nor sufficiently developed to support climate migrants—particularly migrants from South Asia, Central America, Northwest Africa, and the Horn of Africa.
Time to envision legal recourse for climate refugees
As gradually worsening climate patterns and, even more so, severe weather events, prompt an increase in human mobility, people who choose to move will do so with little legal protection. The current system of international law is not equipped to protect climate migrants, as there are no legally binding agreements obliging countries to support climate migrants.
While climate migrants who flee unbearable conditions resemble refugees, the legal protections afforded to refugees do not extend to them. In the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations established a system to protect civilians who had been forced from their home countries by political violence. Today, there are almost 20.4 million officially designated refugees under the protection of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)—however, there is an additional group of 21.5 million people23 who flee their homes as a result of sudden onset weather hazards every year.24
The UNHCR has thus far refused to grant these people refugee status, instead designating them as “environmental migrants,” in large part because it lacks the resources to address their needs. But with no organized effort to supervise the migrant population, these desperate individuals go where they can, not necessarily where they should. As their numbers grow, it will become increasingly difficult for the international community to ignore this challenge. As severe climate change displaces more people, the international community may be forced to either redefine “refugees” to include climate migrants or create a new legal category and accompanying institutional framework to protect climate migrants. However, opening that debate in the current political context would be fraught with difficulty. Currently, the nationalist, anti-immigrant, and xenophobic atmosphere in Europe and the U.S. would most likely lead to limiting refugee protections rather than expanding them.
The SDGs can help, but not without an update to the US response
While there are no legally binding international regimes that protect climate migrants, there are voluntary compacts that could be used to support them. Most notably, 193 countries adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which address both migration and climate change.
Several of the 169 targets established by the SDGs lay out general goals that could be used to protect climate migrants. SDG 13 on climate action outlines several targets that address the climate crisis:

13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning
13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

To meet these goals, extensive bilateral and multilateral development assistance will be needed. The U.S. must create a strategic approach to focus development assistance and multilateral organizations on those targets—particularly to create resilient societies that can keep people in their communities.
Although the SDGs do not explicitly link climate change and migration, SDG target 10.7 calls for signatories to “facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed policies.” Again, the United States should channel multilateral development assistance to support the implementation of this target.
The scale and scope of climate change demand dynamic and comprehensive solutions. The U.S. must address climate stress on vulnerable populations specifically, rather than funneling more money into existing programs that operate on the periphery of the growing crisis.
U.S. development agencies and international development financial institutions need to redirect their development assistance to incorporate today’s unfolding climate crisis. Significantly more resources will need to be channeled to the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC), USAID, the Green Climate Fund, UNHCR, as well as to other critical international bodies, in particular those that make up the International Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations.
The Obama administration undertook myriad efforts to update the institutions that can address climate. Several of President Obama’s executive orders, particularly Executive Order 13677, which required incorporating climate resilience into decisionmaking on development assistance, took on the climate crisis. For the first time in the Department of Defense’s history, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recognized climate change as a “threat multiplier,” with the potential to exacerbate current challenges.25
While the current administration has deemphasized or opposed climate-friendly approaches, the current security implications of the migration crisis might prompt a re-examination of those policies. There should be bipartisan support, particularly in the security community, for reducing the conditions that accelerate international migration.
The case for scaling up US action to confront the climate crisis
A variety of medium-term investments (five to 10 years) could create more resilience to the effects of climate change. For example, the climate change factors that push migration in Northwest Africa could—at least in part—be addressed by supporting irrigation infrastructure, providing food supplies, fostering regional water cooperation, and supporting livelihood security.26
Dedicating greater resources to mitigate climate migration is also part of an effective solution. Research is needed to determine the best way to improve the migratory process itself—be it increasing migration monitors, providing safer modes of transport, and consolidating and expanding destination country integration resources.
This discussion is not new: In 2010, Center for American Progress staff were part of a task force that suggested a “Unified Security Budget” for the United States, to address complex crisis scenarios that transcend the traditional division of labor among defense, diplomacy, and development.27 The need for longer-term, more calculated assessment strategies and investments has only increased over the past decade. The Pentagon already supports a variety of operational missions that respond to sudden onset climate disasters. The Navy, in particular, serves at the emergency hotline for international extreme weather events and mobilized to support the Haitian people after the 2010 earthquake, the Filipino people after the 2013 typhoon, and the Nepalis after the 2015 earthquake.
Alternatively, creating a single dedicated fund (by drawing funds from Operations and Maintenance, Research and Development, and the Refugee Assistance Fund) would allow the United States to streamline and refine its support strategies, address the effects of climate change directly, and rebuild its reputation abroad. Such a dedicated fund should try to emulate and partner with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), Germany’s Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), and Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA). American seed funding in this area could lead to major investments of allies and partners—and in cooperation with the development agencies of these countries can mobilize massive resources at the scale required to confront the global climate crisis.
The strategies to address climate migrants presented here are far reaching, but this crisis will only intensify, and our response to it will define international relations in the 21st century.

When will the United States get serious about global climate change? Barely a week passes without news of some new scientific study showing that the effects of climate change will be worse than previously imagined. Massive, systematic assessments of climate science—including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group I have contributed to for years—regularly report on the growing scientific consensus. And, if all that seems abstract, today huge areas of the western United States are literally on fire—extreme wildfires are one of the many things that will likely become more common in a warmer world.

Co-Chair - Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate





Yet, policy across most of the United States seems stuck. Some places like California and parts of Europe are moving ahead more quickly, of course. But the leaders only account for a small fraction of the global total emissions, and most of the leaders are falling short of pledges they made in Paris. Overall, the total global effort is falling far short. For my colleagues in the scientific community, this gap between the need for action and what’s happening on the ground is a source of extreme frustration. We can work harder to show the science is solid, but the problems aren’t scientific—they are political.
In all this bad news about policy inaction, there is also some bad news emerging in climate science that might change the picture. Two bads could change the political landscape on global climate policy. That’s the message from a team of us, published last month in Foreign Affairs.

Climate Change
Undiplomatic action: A practical guide to the new politics and geopolitics of climate change

David G. Victor and Bruce Jones
February 2018






For decades, most of the science about the impacts of climate change has focused, inconveniently, on impacts that will disproportionately hurt poor nations and peoples. Rising sea levels, for example, could wipe out poor small island countries. Higher seas and stronger storms could, as well, put millions of Bangladeshis under water, and with greater threats of the storms and surges they already suffer. In the rich countries, strong storms and higher seas will have a big dollar impact—witness superstorm Sandy in New York and New Jersey, or Harvey in Houston last year—but, in the bigger picture, these rich societies have the resources to respond. As political scientist Aaron Wildavsky put it in a famous essay from the 1980s: “Richer is Safer.”
Politically, the Wildavsky logic creates huge problems for global climate policy. That’s because most greenhouse gas emissions come from richer countries (although the middle-income nations such as China and India are rising quickly) but the impacts are felt the most in the poorer nations. Worse still, nearly all greenhouse gases are stock pollutants—they build up in the atmosphere over decades. Societies today can spend a lot of money to control emissions, but the full benefits won’t be felt for a long time. These geophysical attributes of climate pollutants define the politics for the most part: Solving the climate change problem requires that richer countries (which are the biggest emitters, mostly, and must take the lead) spend large resources for benefits that accrue far into the future, and mostly in other societies.
Some of the new science on climate impacts will change those politics. Particularly notable, as we say in the new Foreign Affairs essay, is the science around the impacts on disease and human health. While the Wildavsky logic still applies—richer societies are more resilient to health impacts, to a point—the effects of climate change as a catalyst for disease could become a great leveler for exposure. It’s one thing when climate harms remote communities who are unknown and have no political voice within the rich countries, but it’s quite another when the harm hits home. And, psychologically, when those harms hit our bodies, the political effects may be greater still. Richer is no longer automatically safer.
It’s quite another when the harm hits home.
Even if political support for climate action grows, there is still a lot that needs to be done. Segments of the population in the United States and abroad still don’t want to believe climate science—a form of denialism that is less rooted in industrial politics and more ideological, especially for the right wing of the Republican party and its denialist compatriots overseas. Even in places that are leading the policy charge—like my home state of California—we have yet to devise a strategy that converts leadership into wider followership, which is what matters.
Building the political support needed for effective climate policy has proven to be a devilishly difficult task. Scientists have, increasingly, found themselves on the periphery of that task. But the new science of climate impacts could change that.

Climate change threatens all people, creatures, places, and systems on the planet, but not all impacts are distributed equally. Climate justice considers that climate change has unequal social, economic, health, and other effects on underprivileged populations. As well, in the U.S., the coronavirus’ uneven impact on Black and Hispanic Americans and the recent reckoning with racial justice issues expose how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts these U.S. populations. Christina Kwauk, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at Brookings, interviews two people to unpack the issues on climate justice in the U.S. and around the world. Justin Worland is a D.C.-based correspondent for Time magazine covering issues on energy and the environment. Marinel Ubaldo is a climate activist from the Philippines and a founder of Youth Leaders for Environmental Action Federation. She also organized the Philippines’ first youth climate strike in 2019.

As wildfires scorch the west, and multiple hurricanes threaten the Atlantic coasts, it is clear that even amidst a global pandemic the problem of climate change requires attention. One barrier to action has been the inability to get the financial markets fully engaged. They move trillions of dollars, and if moved in the right ways they could be a powerful force for good.

In 2015, Mark Carney, then head of England’s central bank, rattled those markets (and the op-ed pages even more) by warning that global equities markets were poised for a major shock when governments started to regulate emissions of gases that contributed to global warming. The valuation of oil and gas companies, like many others, would be shattered as governments forced a transition away from big polluting activities, he warned. This “transition risk,” as it is known, wouldn’t just cause financial instability, but those impacts might also reverberate through the real economy.
What if Mark Carney’s warnings about market instability were right, but the real logic for financial stress was different? The real problem that climate change poses for the markets isn’t “transition risk,” but the mounting physical harms that will come in a warming world. Transition risk hasn’t much materialized because most governments aren’t doing much to impose deep cuts on emissions. With that failure, the world is headed for a lot more climate change — more droughts, more and stronger storms, wildfires, and many other hazards.
In new Brookings research, we are investigating the hypothesis that the physical risks of climate change are the real worry for financial instability. Over the next few months we will be digging deeper, working with partners who model catastrophic risks like hurricanes, studying the vulnerability of infrastructure, and analyzing how government policy perniciously invites investors to do risky things like build houses in the paths of hurricanes. This effort comes at a time when many other groups are worried about the same questions of financial instability (for example here and here).
This first paper looks at a foundational question: What do the markets already know about climate risk? Our answers come from looking at what firms and governments disclose to investors. More disclosure leads to better-informed investors and raises the odds that valuations will reflect real risks and capital will flow to the right places — for instance, ensuring that retirements funds are invested safely, and that infrastructure is built with environmental resiliency in mind.
We focus on the U.S. and on two classes of investments in particular: public equities (that is, stocks) and municipal debt. There’s a lot more climate disclosure information about equities — thanks in part to work from groups like Ceres that are putting a spotlight on these important investments. By contrast, very little is known about what the municipal debt markets know about climate change. That should be deeply worrying because municipalities are on the front lines of the physical impacts of climate change, such as the communities in California that have been eliminated by wildfires. Firms whose stocks trade can move around as needed and adjust. But you can’t move a city. Because municipalities are on the front lines, we start there.
The risks to municipalities
The municipal debt market stands at $3.9 trillion, and is a primary way that cities fund their basic infrastructure, such as toll roads, hospitals, and water systems. Understanding the exposures of municipalities requires estimating how climate change will hurt these assets, which is hard to do because most climate models run at very coarse geographical resolution. A few private companies are now doing this kind of analysis (for example, flagship firms such as AIR, and newer startups such as 427 and risQ). For analysts like us, who work in the public domain, notably helpful is academic research that is now delivering this information, such as the Climate Impact Lab (CIL).
A first fix on what’s happening comes from crossing information about the level of harm each community faces with what those same communities disclose when they borrow money from the market. Figure 1 shows the result for 590 U.S. counties, and nearly 1,500 municipal bonds randomly sampled from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Boards (MSRB’s) EMMA website.
Figure 1
A sample of general obligation (GO) and revenue bonds from the most and least at risk municipalities with populations > 100,000. Objective measures of risk (horizontal axis) are from CIL estimates of income losses due to climate change for the year 2080. (We are mindful that maturities for these bonds are nearly always earlier, but out year estimates of median income loss are directionally consistent with nearer-term risks of material perils). Source: Climate Impact Lab, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and analysis by the authors.
No matter how we slice the data — and we’ve looked at it lots of ways — there is no relationship between what the scientists know about climate risk and what these municipalities tell the markets about the risks they face. The data on the figure are a cloud.
This is concerning because most people, when they think about climate risks, they imagine a catastrophic event sweeping through town — like a hurricane or a flood. The big dangers that face communities, however, seem to be chronic events like repeated floods and heat stress that empty out communities, erode the tax base, and make it harder for municipalities to invest in the long term.
The risks to companies
Turning to equities, the picture is a lot better. As shown in Figure 2 — which tracks average mentions of climate change risks by the 3,000 most important traded stocks — disclosure has gone way up since 2009. Today, about 60% of companies do say something about climate change in their public 10-k filings.
Figure 2
While disclosure levels have increased overall since 2009, the average number of risk mentions in 10-k disclosures is skewed towards transition risk. This analysis was developed using the Ceres’ SEC Sustainability Disclosure Search Tool, created in collaboration with Cook ESG Research, Morningstar, and the University of Melbourne. Using an algorithm to data mine and machine read SEC 10-k’s filings, we are able to identify and catalog climate change mentions per 10-k. Source: Ceres/Cook/Morningstar 10-K database and analysis by the authors.
There’s a big bias in the picture: Disclosure about transition risk (what Mark Carney was worried about, in the main) has gone up a lot. But American corporate leaders say a lot less about their exposure to physical risk. Put differently, firms are getting good at telling investors what they already know — for example, about emissions and about the risks that government will regulate aggressively. But they say little about the place where the market is still flying blind: the physical risks of climate change.
What to do? 
Fixing the disclosure problem isn’t easy, and better disclosure by itself won’t assure that our societies are better prepared for the large and growing impacts of a changing climate. But there is an urgent need to rebalance the disclosure debate toward physical risks. Even if governments start cutting emissions quickly, warming is already accelerating and the odds of severe impacts are rising quickly. Organizations like the California Coastal Commission are updating their planning systems with extreme sea level rise scenarios, for example. We must brace ourselves for a lot of climate change, and if we are unlucky those changes will be quite severe.
Some solutions lie with better rules on required disclosure — rules that, today, are mostly to issuers to interpret on their own and that stem from uneven application of existing rules such as at the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to better rules, many issuers need help seeing good models — especially in the municipal debt market. Municipalities that have big staffs working on climate-related topics can help by demonstrating practical methods for better disclosure. The costs for serious analysis of exposures remain high, and some of the key tools are hard to use. Fixing that problem will take time, but a place to start is with audits of public infrastructure (so that assets at risk and possible damages are easier to tabulate) and making publicly available climate hazard maps at a granular level. The credit ratings agencies are quickly learning a lot about climate risks and more transparency around those methods — while still protecting proprietary tools — would help catalyze a fuller public debate about what’s at stake.
Central to the problem of disclosure are two factors that quantitative analysts rarely talk much about. One is imagination: Part of the failure to reveal more information about physical risks of climate change is that market players have yet to see regular evidence of all the ways in which climate change will cause harm. Many of the harms that are easiest to imagine (e.g., hurricanes) may prove less threatening than those with longer term harmful impacts (e.g., heat stress). The other is policy signals that are still pointed in the wrong direction — creating a “moral hazard” that encourages people to invest in ways that invite climate damages because they believe that government (such as through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA) will bail them out.
Climate change is a topic that inspires emotive responses. That emotion helps explain ongoing gridlock in policy and why grappling with the impacts of climate change has become so much more urgent over the last decade. Getting this wrong has big implications for the financial markets, 401(k) retirement accounts, and the ability of communities to raise funds for schools and hospitals — problems everyone cares about, even when they are divided on so much else.

Flying blind: What do investors really know about climate change risks in the U.S. equity and municipal debt markets?

With the unexpected triumph of Donald Trump, what’s in store for U.S. climate policy? Answering that question is hard since Trump has never run a public institution and thus has no track record. His most cited comment about global warming—that it was a Chinese hoax invented to destroy American jobs—came in November 2012 from a 19-word tweet, hardly the medium for reasoned policy analysis. In my lifetime, no one has ever become president after having said so little about what they would actually do with the reins of power.

With so little to guide predictions, the reality of a Trump presidency has become a national Rorschach test. Conservatives and the anti-establishment imagine an ascendant Trump will set a path for a more competitive national economy, smaller government, and a stronger defense. The left predicts a horror show of policy reversals and seediness. This Rorschach test is now playing out as the country grapples with what all this means for climate and energy.
One thing is clear: The Trump administration will inflict more harm on global cooperation around climate than any prior president. After the successful Paris agreement last year, that cooperation was finally poised to make progress with decisive U.S. leadership. I doubt that a Trump presidency will kill the Paris process—too many other countries are too invested in its success. But it will shift the intellectual and political leadership of the process from the United States to other countries, most notably China.
One thing is clear: The Trump administration will inflict more harm on global cooperation around climate than any prior president.
For people who want to see America engaged in serious global cooperation and a continued decarbonization of the U.S. energy system, the likely chaos of the Trump administration—as it moves from the bombast of campaign yelling and tweeting to the much harder task of running a government—will require new political strategies. Activists and politicians who care about climate issues should alter their thinking to making those new strategies a reality. They need to focus on how to offset the harmful effects of Trump on global diplomacy—something that is possible, to some degree. And they need to gear up for policy action in the states (and defenses of existing policies through the courts). A Trump presidency will cause huge anguish for environmentalists and offer a powerful symbol for raising money and political opposition, but sharp thinking is needed to make sure that opposition is actually effective in protecting the planet.
Combating global climate change under a Trump presidency
The most immediate effect of Trump’s rise will be in how the United States works with other countries. Climate change is a global problem: The United States accounts for only 16 percent of total annual emissions and thus the only way to affect the global picture is through leadership and cooperation. Paris worked where other efforts, such as the Kyoto Protocol, largely failed because it adopted a more flexible, “bottom up” approach to governance that the United States had been advocating for years. This flexible approach made it possible to get more countries engaged and set the stage for a truly global effort to cut emissions.
Literally overnight, the U.S. role in this process has changed. Foreign nations may have overreacted to Trump’s tweet about a Chinese hoax in global warming, but clearly the Trump team is hostile to climate policy, a point confirmed by selecting the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Myron Ebell (a deep skeptic of climate science and an even starker critic of most environmental policy) as head of the team overseeing the Trump transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has stated he will “cancel” the Paris agreement, which is not something he himself can actually do. A Trump administration could withdraw from Paris or even from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (the parent of the Paris agreement), both processes that can unfold fairly quickly (one to three years). But unlike earlier administrations—such as George W. Bush’s, which abandoned the Kyoto Protocol before the United States tried to ratify the agreement, or George H.W. Bush’s, which never submitted the Convention on Biological Diversity for U.S. ratification—the Trump administration will soon find that it is very difficult and diplomatically costly to abandon existing treaty commitments. This is unlikely to be a high priority for a newly elected president who devoted virtually zero attention to climate policy during the campaign. All the drama created by Trump’s statements will be fodder for dramatic U.N. floor speeches, and some are already being delivered in Marrakech. But by themselves they won’t amount to much real impact on climate diplomacy.

Climate Change
The Paris Agreement and its future

Todd Stern
October 2018







The most harmful impacts of the Trump presidency on climate cooperation will come in two other ways. First is funding. In Paris, nations reconfirmed a pledge to provide $100 billion in new money to help developing countries engage with climate policy, with a large fraction earmarked for the least developed countries that are the most exposed to the harms of unchecked warming. Nobody really knows what counts as new money, but as a sign of good faith, the developed nations put up $10 billion to get started—one-third from the United States, and one-third from China. America has not yet paid all of its commitment, and it seems clear that Trump will not. For the developing countries, this will be a sign that America is unreliable and that the benefits of staying engaged in climate negotiations are fleeting. While these countries are generally not large greenhouse gas emitters, having their support is essential to making formal decisions—including adoption of the Paris agreement.
The other big harm that Trump will cause almost immediately to the Paris process will come when the United States no longer leads in the long, difficult process of putting the accord into effect. The Paris agreement is what’s known as “pledge and review.” Countries make pledges to cut emissions and adopt various policies, and then every few years those efforts are reviewed. Success hinges on review, and until Tuesday it was assumed that the United States would help show the world how good review systems actually work. Indeed, the United States, along with China, had already done that in volunteering itself for peer review of its fossil fuel subsidy reform policies. Without leadership, the review process will probably follow narrow and bureaucratic U.N. rules, which are the only rules countries can agree upon right now, so formal review will be impotent.

Still Ours to Lead


						By Bruce D. Jones

The ability to get countries to cut emissions will suffer as the fragile coalition that created Paris splinters and as the process loses its biggest champion for turning the promise of the Paris agreement into a functioning diplomatic machinery. My guess is that this won’t kill the Paris process, but it will severely weaken it.
The most interesting impact of all this may be on China. For the last few years, the United States and China played a central role in building the Paris regime through their “G-2” bilateral efforts on energy innovation and joint announcements of emission cutting goals and policies. That approach of country-tailored commitments is enshrined in the pledge and review process that helped make Paris a success (As I wrote last December). The Chinese have favored this approach for its flexibility, and while the G-2 relationship may quickly die (or go into hibernation) under Trump, China’s commitment to this approach won’t. If the United States leaves Paris and eliminates its leadership role, that leaves China to steer the ship.
Capacity outside government
Uncertainties abound over what a future Trump administration may look like on energy and climate policy. Yet as the shock of his victory wears off, it will be essential to look realistically at what he can and can’t do.
In foreign policy, he has huge leverage, and he could cause a lot of harm to the progress already made. Friends of climate change diplomacy should gear up to help explain to the world that not all of the Trumpian bluster will be followed by reality. Senior diplomats out of power—along with leaders of NGOs and of firms that have a stake in effective global strategies—should help reassure the world that America has not abandoned its climate commitments forever. It is also crucial to look for places where the gaps created as Trump abandons or weakens climate change diplomacy might be filled in—on the review process, for example, academics and NGOs have already built much of the capacity that will be needed to demonstrate effective review. They should seek allies in those governments that remain committed to Paris—whether in Europe or India or China—to keep the diplomatic ship afloat even as its traditional captain leaves the scene for now.

    Nov 2 (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor aims to reach net-zero emissions of
greenhouse gases from production and final consumption of its energy products by 2050, the
company said on Monday.
    Achieving net-zero emissions required a well-functioning market for carbon capture and
storage (CCS, so-called natural sinks, as well as the development of competitive technologies
for hydrogen, it added.
    Equinor said 'net zero' meant achieving an overall balance between the amount of
greenhouse gases (GHG) added to, and removed from, the atmosphere. 
    It also wants to reduce net carbon intensity to zero by 2050. 
    Intensity-based targets measure the amount of GHG emissions such as methane or carbon
dioxide per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute
emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.

    Sept 30 (Reuters) - France's Total said on Wednesday it aims to reduce
emissions from the burning of its oil and gas products to below the level they had in 2015 by
2030, with an interim goal of slashing around a third off its European direct and indirect
emissions by 2030 before reaching net zero in 2050. 
    Rivals such as BP or Royal Dutch Shell have similar targets covering
emissions from oil products such as diesel or gasoline.
    Top oil and gas companies sell more than they refine and produce themselves by buying
from third parties.
    All their targets depend on offset markets as well as carbon capture and storage
technology not yet used on a commercial scale.
    Intensity-based targets measure the amount of GHG emissions such as methane or carbon
dioxide per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute
emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.

119,/article/idUSKBN25V28N,EU countries consider a climate target for every decade,"By Kate Abnett2 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries are considering a new climate target for 2040, to give the bloc an emissions-cutting goal for each decade between now and 2050, when it hopes to reach “net zero” emissions, under proposals seen by Reuters.FILE PHOTO: A thermometer mounted on a wall of the headquarters of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) shows a temperature of 40 Celsius degrees in Bonn, Germany July 31, 2020. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File PhotoThe EU is aiming to strike a deal this year on a law to make its climate targets legally binding, and member states will start discussions next week on the text.A proposal by Germany, which will lead the talks between countries, would fix a new EU emissions reduction target for 2040 to keep countries on track for the bloc’s flagship goal to become climate neutral by 2050.“Where it is necessary for the achievement of the climate neutrality objective... a Union-wide climate target for 2040 shall be set,” the document said.Currently, the EU has emissions reduction goals for 2020, 2030 and 2050.The climate law will need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. While the 2040 target is unlikely to be a point of contention, lawmakers and countries are split over how strict other parts of the law should be.The German proposal would enforce the EU’s 2050 net zero emissions target at an EU-wide level.Members of the parliament, who will attempt to agree their position on the law next week, want a binding commitment for every member state to decarbonize by 2050.This is opposed by eastern countries who say the goal is unrealistic, but supported by campaigners who say it is aligned with the emissions pathway scientists say would avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.“This should be a no brainer,” Greenpeace climate policy adviser Sebastian Mang said, of setting national 2050 climate neutrality goals.Reporting by Kate Abnett; Editing by Frances KerryOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

121,/article/idUSL8N2HX5U5,Climate activists urge Attenborough to pass the mic on Insta,"By Sophie Davies3 Min Read(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Youth climate activists have urged David Attenborough to ‘pass the mic’ rather than jettison Instagram after just six weeks, saying the British naturalist should not abandon his 6 million followers.Attenborough’s team opened the Instagram account in September to coincide with the cinema release of ‘A Life on Our Planet’ documentary.It attracted 6.1 million followers before the team announced plans to close after its 27 posts garnered the sort of following usually reserved for actors or influencers.Climate activists said in a statement late on Tuesday that the documentary had provoked a “tidal wave” of interest, urging Attenborough to rethink so others benefitted from his fanbase.“With 6 million engaged followers at your fingertips, it only makes sense to keep the momentum going,” said 27-year-old British-based activist Tori Tsui.The activists - from fifteen countries - said Instagram had alerted a new audience to the perils of a warming planet and that closing the account would be a wasted opportunity in the fight on climate change.“Activists...have expressed a deep concern over the team’s decision, highlighting it as a missed opportunity for climate education, given it has the power to reach millions of engaged people,” they said.The youth activists hail from several global organisations, including the Fridays For Future NGO that emerged from Greta Thunberg’s school strike for climate movement.They urged Attenborough to #PassTheMic to communities on the frontlines of climate change, including Black and indigenous groups, to boost chances for global action.“The campaign focuses on making sure that youth activists, especially from the Global South are empowered and able to share their stories in their own way,” Mitzi Jonelle Tan, from Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.A spokeswoman for the documentary producers said the social media account was only ever intended as a series of special Attenborough messages to run over a limited period.“Audiences have followed on the basis that they will see filmed messages from him, and it is therefore not possible for us to hand over the account to anyone,” she said.She said the account would instead recommend accounts to follow on environmental issues, offering activists a powerful new tool to spread the word.“This is where social media comes in…going to where the youth can really see our messages and calls, through dance videos on TikTok or pictures on Instagram or witty lines on Twitter,” Tan said.Reporting by Sophie Davies, editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

Globalization has entered a new phase, led by the increasing digitalization of international trade. Data flows are the conveyer belt of this transformation. New avenues for trade, innovation, and productivity growth are being created, but there are also risks. In my chapter in the just-published book “Growth in a Time of Change,” I examine the new opportunities and policy challenges.
Access and use of data can be a driver of trade, innovation, and productivity growth
Data are driving innovation, with opportunity for a new wave of productivity growth. Currently, approximately half of the world is online. Between 2005 and 2021, global internet traffic will increase 127fold.  The rollout of the 5G network will support the ”internet of things” (IoT), such that by 2021, the number of devices connected to the internet will be triple the global population.

The ability to move data seamlessly and globally is supporting new business models, spurring research and development, facilitating international collaboration, and transforming international trade. Already, around 12 percent of global goods trade is via international e-commerce. E-commerce provides a potentially significant opportunity to increase small businesses’ participation in international trade, as having a website gives them an instant international presence, and e-commerce platforms provide embedded services such as financial payments and support with logistics. In Korea for instance, 100 percent of firms on eBay have cross-border sales, compared with 20 percent of offline firms.
Services are being increasingly traded online. This includes information technology (IT), professional, financial, retail, and education services. New digital services, such as cloud computing, have been developed and are becoming crucial business inputs.
Digital technologies are also being exported as part of traditional goods exports. For example, data collected from sensors on mining and farming equipment allow businesses to improve their operations and thereby the value from the use of such equipment.
Global data flows underpin global value chains (GVC), creating new opportunities for participation in international trade. The global internet and data flows enable businesses to plug into GVCs to offer their own specific service. Again, in the case of Korea for example, this is a particular opportunity for new and smaller Korean firms to participate in supply chains in Asia.
But restrictions on data flows are growing
As the opportunities presented by digital technologies grow, governments and regulators have to determine how to benefit from going digital while maintaining the integrity of their domestic regulations. Against this backdrop, there has been significant growth in data localization measures globally.
There are various forms of restrictions on data flows. They include measures that disallow the transfer of data outside national borders; measures that allow cross-border transfers but require a copy to be maintained domestically; and requirements of prior consent before data can be transferred overseas. Data localization measures often include restrictions on data flows.

Measures that restrict data flows and require data to be localized are implemented for a range of reasons. One reason, which is the case with privacy regulations, is to prevent data flows to jurisdictions with lower levels of privacy protection where this undermines domestic privacy protections. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect in May 2018, prohibits businesses that collect personal data in the EU from transferring it outside the EU unless the receiving country has an equivalent level of privacy protection (personal data can also be transferred in a limited number of other circumstances).
Governments can also require data to be localized on the grounds that regulators need access to data in order to perform their regulatory functions. The most common of these is in the financial services sector, where data localization requirements are justified on the basis that financial regulators require financial data to remain local in case they need access to it for regulatory purposes. For instance, in 2018 India introduced a requirement that payment system operators store data locally in order to allow financial regulators to effectively perform their supervisory function.
Ensuring cybersecurity is another rationale for requiring data to be localized. The view here is that data localization decreases the risks of unauthorized access. Another reason for data flows restrictions is to control access to what content can be accessed online, usually on moral, religious or political grounds. For example, Iran’s censorship aimed at creating the ”Halal Internet” limits access to content deemed offensive to Islam. China blocks access to 11 of the top 25 global sites among an estimated 3,000 prohibited foreign websites.
Data localization measures are also being enacted for protectionist reasons. China’s blocking or degrading of internet access has supported the development of local champions. For instance, blocking access to Google and Facebook has been to the benefit of Baidu, Renren, and Sina Weibo.
The WTO includes commitments that support digital trade and provide space for legitimate regulation
Trade rules are important as enablers of digital trade and as brakes on government regulation that can restrict digital trade opportunities. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was negotiated in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the internet flourished. Yet, WTO rules are relevant for digital trade. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is particularly relevant given the increasing scope for services trade. Where WTO members have made a commitment to allow the delivery of a service, they must also allow data to flow across borders where that is needed for the delivery of the service. As a result, data localization measures that increase the burden on foreign suppliers, such as by requiring a local presence, could be inconsistent with the GATS national treatment commitment. A WTO member could seek to justify a data localization measure under the GATS Article XIV exception provision, as being necessary to achieve an enumerated list of public policy exceptions.
More comprehensive digital trade rules are being developed in free trade agreements
Since 2003, at least 70 free trade agreements (FTAs) include an e-commerce chapter. The United States-Korea FTA, for instance, includes the first explicit general commitment to cross-border data flows. However, unlike more recent FTAs, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the commitment is only in terms of “best endeavors.” The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the United States-Japan Trade Agreement include more comprehensive commitments, including to allow free flow of information and avoid data localization requirements, subject to appropriate exceptions provisions. FTA commitments relevant for digital trade extend beyond the digital trade chapter and include rules on intellectual property, such as a commitment to develop third-party intermediary liability regimes (as in USMCA article 20.J.11).

International trade commitments at the WTO and in FTAs provide an important discipline on unnecessary restrictions on digital trade. Trade rules in FTAs are also beginning to go further than merely preventing digital trade restrictions and are also including commitments for regulatory cooperation and to develop interoperability among regulatory systems. This is significant, as more international regulatory cooperation is needed in order to give domestic regulators confidence that moving data outside of their jurisdiction won’t undermine domestic regulatory goals. At the moment, the absence of common standards or mechanisms for interoperability among regulatory systems is one reason governments are increasingly requiring data to remain local.

More men than women are killed in car crashes each year, partly because men drive more and engage in riskier driving behavior. On the other hand, women are 17% more likely to be killed and 47% more likely to be injured in crashes than men are. Women are at increased risk simply because they are women: cars are primarily designed, built, and tested by male engineers using male data, so they are built with men in mind. Scaled-down versions of male crash test dummies, meant to represent women, were not used until 2003—and are primarily tested in the passenger seat. In car design, development, and testing, male bodies are the standard and female bodies the outlier. This creates a gender data gap with very real impacts on the lives of Americans.

The gender data gap appears in health and medicine, too. Heart disease kills more people in the United States than anything else, accounting for approximately 20% of female deaths and 25% of male deaths. But survival rates for women are substantially worse than they are for men, and the gender data gap is partly to blame. Historically, heart disease research was primarily conducted on male subjects by male scientists and doctors, so male symptoms are considered typical and female symptoms atypical. As a result, women are misdiagnosed up to 50% more often and are more likely to be dismissed without treatment. Even when treated, women are less likely to receive needed medications or advice. And simply including women in research is not enough: when research findings are not sex-disaggregated, men are still considered the norm.[1]
The gender data gap affects military service as well. Retention of women is a perennial, persistent, and well-established problem, but the services have never meaningfully tracked why women leave the military at higher rates. A range of factors—rigid career paths, restrictive policies on parental leave and postpartum fitness, and cultural problems such as the Marines United scandal and high sexual assault rates—are suspected to disproportionately impact women. Yet the primarily-male leadership only recently adopted a recommendation to start tracking retention drivers on a voluntary basis. These efforts will remain inadequate until the scope of analysis is broadened, population pool is increased, and time has passed. Until then, the gap remains robust.
Rethinking the default
The endangerment of American citizens is concerning enough, but the gender data gap also creates a vicious cycle of underrepresentation in leadership across the nation. When leaders are primarily male, they are less likely to consider women as they develop and implement policy. And the policies they enact further neglect women, so the cycle continues. When men become the default, women are an afterthought. Their bodies, needs, and contributions are neglected, and their participation as leaders at every level is limited.
If the male perspective is assumed to be the standard and the female perspective is the “other”, the institutions that rest on that assumption, the decision-making processes leaders employ, and the policy choices that result suffer. This limits government effectiveness, and nowhere is this more critical than in the context of national security. To understand security challenges and develop means to successfully address them, leaders must seek the fullest picture possible. If women are not at the decision-making table and those in command do not consider female perspectives, that picture remains incomplete.
Closing the gap
For this nation to succeed and prosper in the future, the gender data gap must be recognized and it must be narrowed.  There are three main steps to accomplish this.

Gender issues in India: an amalgamation of research

First, research must explore the gender data gap. Instead of considering the average male the norm, gender diversity in research must be actively sought. By exploring how diverse people are affected by various phenomena, research findings can inform government structures, their functions, and the policies that result.
Second, research must explore how diverse teams and leaders impact organizations, particularly in government. The business case for diversity is being established, and research into diversity in other areas is promising: research into diversity in medicine found that female doctors have higher patient survival rates, and male doctors’ performance improved when they worked with female physicians. But the rest of the country must catch up. Research can demonstrate how diversity, particularly gender diversity, affects American lives.

Finally, leaders must actively seek diversity. While the gender data gap is narrowed through research, including the perspectives of those who live in the gap can fill in the blanks. There is precedent for this. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted 19 years ago, established that women must be included at all levels of leadership to achieve peace and stability. The United States’ own Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017 states that “the political participation and leadership of women…is critical to sustaining democratic institutions; and… helps promote more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to country and regional stability.” For policies to work, institutions to function, and security to last, diverse perspectives must be included.
Until the gender data gap is narrowed, the lack of data, and the underrepresentation of women that feeds and is fed by it, will continue to limit the effectiveness of private, public, and non-profit organizations. But the gender data gap will not close on its own—we must actively seek to close it, the sooner the better. As Malala Yousafzai declared in her 2013 address at the United Nations, “We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.”

PER-CAPITA INCOME IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA LAGS BEHIND OTHER REGIONS
In a report on Africa’s consumer market potential, Landry Signé notes that while income growth and labor productivity have been increasing in Africa in recent years, per-capita income levels remain below all other regions.

 
IN 2017 sub-Saharan Africa’s MVA was about $145 billion
Signé, who is a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Global Economy and Development Program at Brookings, also studied the potential of manufacturing and industrialization in Africa. In that report, he calls attention to some “worrying trends,” including low manufacturing value added in Africa compared to the rest of the world. However, he notes, “manufacturing in Africa has grown 3.5 percent annually from 2005 to 2014—faster than it has in the rest of the world.”

In 2019, about 70 percent of the world’s poor will live in Africa
Homi Kharas, Kristofer Hamel, and Martin Hofer, writing on the reduction of extreme poverty worldwide, say that “the good news is that 2019 will start with the lowest prevalence of extreme poverty ever recorded in human history—less than 8 percent.” However, the reduction rate is slowing, and Africa’s share is rising. “However,” the authors add, “there is light at the end of the tunnel. In 2019, for the first time since the enactment of the [Sustainable Development Goals], Africa will start reducing the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty, albeit very modestly.”

A little more than a year ago, the international community endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals. While the goals reinforced attention to previously identified challenges in health, education, and sanitation, there were also new areas of focus brought forth, including a call for a “data revolution.” But what do we actually mean when we think of the data revolution in connection to social and economic development? What are some of the examples that we can show? I often ask these simple questions to friends and colleagues but, somehow, never get a very clear answer.

Let’s step back and consider the digital revolution thus far. Do you remember when you saw a computer for the first time and how you experienced the internet initially?
My first computer was an Atari, which I got in 1990. I wrote my first university seminar papers on it. Loading time was around five minutes, even though I would only use word processing. The software had to be loaded from a floppy disks (those born after 1990 can google what it was) because disk space was unusual at that time. In hindsight it seems like it must have been really painful. At the time it was bliss, considering the alternative was my mother’s typewriter and removing each mistake with Tipp-Ex or retyping the whole page.
A few years later, at the end of 1994, I had my first encounter with email and the internet. Our university had one computer room where you could connect. We would converge to that room, in a separate building, to go “online” much in the same way as our grandparents in the 1950s would huddle around the one TV set that the wealthy neighbor owned. But the internet then was very different: It was just text, with links to other pages equally packed with text. I used to think how nice it would be to have a few pictures and a more playful way to interact.
Another memorable moment was in the spring of 2000, shortly after I joined the World Bank. My mentor who was already in his 50s came proudly to my office to show me something only he knew about in our department. It was a search engine, which had a clear and simple interface and gave you answers instantly. This was the first time I used Google.
The commonality between all of these big tech innovations of our lifetime—the personal computer, email, and the internet—is that they succeeded through simplification and personalization. It was the genius of Bill Gates and Paul Allen to understand that software would change the way people around the world worked and played. Since then “computers” have evolved from clunky machines to stylish items featured in most offices and homes (at least in the developed world). Virtually anyone can use a computer for daily work, transactions, or bookings without the help of specialized technology staff.

Future Development
Three reasons for universal basic income

Shanta Devarajan
Wednesday, February 15, 2017






This is exactly the type of “revolution” that we are still waiting for in the field of data. Data scientists and software engineers can build the machines and tools that we need to collect, mine, curate, and analyze data. But we should all be able to use them. We should make the same bet that Gates and Allen made a generation ago and personalize (big) data in a way that empowers individual users. The experience should be playful, pleasant, and simple.
This big transformation is yet to come in many segments of society and sectors of work. This is even true for economists who work most of the day with data but often still operate in a 20th century pre-data revolution world. In this “ancient regime” we have experts—mainly statisticians and economists—who crunch official data and make projections. The public accepts this official wisdom, until forecasts get corrected by the same actors.
This old model needs an upgrade, badly. The opportunities are enormous, ranging from leveraging data traces from the world’s 7 billion cell phones to exploiting high-quality satellite imagery (for which costs are declining rapidly). However, the breakthrough will not come from technology alone, and the true game changer will be when data collection, aggregation, and communication is effectively democratized. For that to happen an important first step is to learn to live with the imperfection of the existing data and of the systems that generate them. If we are transparent about these imperfections, we can create systems for improvements and error correction.
Here are three surprising findings from population.io, a tool (I helped develop) that personalizes demographic data and tells you among other things, how long you might expect to live:

A girl born in Korea today can expect to live 99 years. This makes Korea the country with the highest life expectancy in the world.
A 45-year old Russian man has a lower life expectancy than the same man in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By contrast, Russian women in the same age bracket live 10 years longer than in the Congo.
If you are 80 years old in Brazil, you can expect to live longer than any other octogenarian in the world. For example, an 80-year old Brazilian woman would live on average another 10.5 years, compared to 10 years in the United States or Germany.

Each of these three examples warrant a closer look at the data. Obviously there are hypotheses to explain these results—girls’ education in South Korea, alcohol abuse in Russia, etc. For the Brazilian case, it is more difficult. If this is an example of a data error, we should correct it. If not, we may create a body of research on the secrets of long lives in Brazil for those who overcame the first 80 years successfully.

In this edition of Charts of the Week, a focus on India, from Brookings India in New Delhi.
Mobility and the rent/own choice in urban India

In their study of the relationship between internal (to a country) migration and “tenure”—the decision to rent or own a home—Arnab Dutta, Sahil Gandhi, and Richard Green write that “the relationship between migration and tenure choice is not stable” in India. Internal migration has been on a rise in India, as shown by comparing census data. The authors find that “internal migrants as a share of the total population increased from 31 percent in 1961 to 37 percent in 2011.” One of the authors’ conclusions is that migrants are less likely to be renters, but the majority of migrants in India are women who are getting married.
Is India losing to China as the neighborhood’s education hub?

Constantino Xavier, Aakshi Chaba, and Geetika Dang examine how “India’s capacity to attract students from neighbouring countries has helped it to form closer political ties and spread its cultural influence and values to the surrounding region.” However, as the chart shows, China is increasingly attracting students from South Asia, most notably from Pakistan, whose students accounted for almost half of South Asian students in China. “This can be explained,” the authors conclude, “by the preferential education policies of China towards Pakistan, a beneficiary of its Belt and Road Initiative through the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor.”
High out-of-pocket expenses in Indian health expenditures

Prachi Singh, Shamika Ravi, and David Dam note that “when it comes to out-of-pocket expenditure as a proportion of current health expenditure, India does much worse in comparison to the world average.” India reports 65% out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPE) when the rest of the world is averaging 20%. The authors conclude that this high level of OOPE “warrants special attention as it leads to impoverishment, with 7% of the households falling below the poverty line on account of health expenses.”

Long before digital technologies appeared on the horizon, there was a very simple defining value of most impact initiatives. Any nonprofit trying to empower a population that had been devastated by some kind of calamity—war, disease, poverty—would immediately be asked by a funder, “How many feet can you have on the ground?”
“Feet on the ground” meant, of course, having a local presence. But impacting the community involved didn’t just mean a better ability to provide services. It also meant having far better information about the problem at hand.

Case in point: Back in the late 2000s, the organization I worked for was helping to plan a way to provide anti-malarial bed nets to Swaziland, distributed through the Anglican Church. We had a local sponsor to help us with introductions, and funding from an American foundation. But when our project manager reached Swaziland, he was told that the infection rates had dropped precipitously. The country had been spraying DDT for the past two years—and our data was over two years old.
Today, we can use data to drive better decisionmaking. But how can we drive exponentially better decisions?
An exponential process increases at a logarithmic rate, in an accelerating curve, rather than a simple, linear progression. To give an example, back in the early 2000s, many of us focused on the intersection of connectivity and development were trying to figure out how internet access could be accelerated in Africa. At that time about 4.5 million were connected. Along came cell phones, the iPhone and its brethren, and suddenly internet penetration accelerated at a blinding rate. Access on the continent grew 100-fold by the end of 2017, to nearly half a billion users.
But to be exponential in our impact—to truly co-create breakthrough solutions to deep challenges—there are several important ways to think about the use of data for impact.

International migration: What happens to those left behind?

First, initiative leaders must have a data mindset from the very beginning. If an initiative doesn’t have the tracking, gathering, dissemination, and use of data infused into the DNA of the project, it can be nearly impossible to gather good data after the fact. Ask the question: If we’re successful, how would we know?
Second, recognize that data is always imperfect. We need to think in terms of “optimization”—using the best data we have under the circumstances. Where may the data be flawed, and how can we continually work to improve data quality? Think of data as a fabric, with flaws that need to be continually filled in and modified.
Third, remember that, when it comes to impact, causation and correlation will remain fuzzy for a long time. Just because left-handed people eat more carrots (or maybe they don’t), that doesn’t mean that eating carrots makes you left-handed. In the same way, the actual impact of health and market interventions doesn’t always show up clearly in the data, and the work of any single initiative may not clearly prove its impact.
Fourth, it takes a village. Few organizations have the scale to own all of the data necessary to understand the impact of even the smallest and most local initiatives. It is critical to work with other data stakeholders to continually improve the quantity and quality of data, and to share that data as openly as possible with other stakeholders. Who are the most important? The people you’re helping to empower, of course. If they aren’t part of the process from the beginning, why are you even doing this initiative?
None of this removes the need for on-the-ground presence and collaborative processes for solving key social and economic challenges. But a deep commitment to the wise use of data can help to put a lot more “virtual feet” on the ground.

In this week’s edition of Charts of the Week, a sampling of health care-related data drawn from the research of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.
Half to two-thirds of ambulance rides involve out-of-network providers
Despite their best efforts to remain in-network, many people seeking medical care often are treated by out-of-network providers, especially in emergency situations. The “surprise billing” that may result can be very large, beyond what the patient thought they would be paying. The chart below shows the most common circumstances leading to out-of-network care. Researchers from the Schaeffer Initiative have studied surprise billing and new approaches to address it.

Pediatric doctors at low end of compensation; orthopedists at top
In a recent Schaeffer Iniative white paper, researchers find that “the U.S. medical education system has produced an increasingly specialized physician workforce without any strategic direction toward achieving a socially desirable mix of primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists.” The charts below shows gaps in earnings across a variety of medical specialties. “We conclude,” the authors write, “that the mix of physicians in the US has too few PCPs and too many specialists, the income gap between the two is a major determinant of the PCP/specialty mix, and Medicare physician payment policy is a major contributor to the income gap.”

“What we pay for medicines today affects the number and kinds of drugs discovered tomorrow,” write the authors of a report published by the Schaeffer Initiative.

The chart below shows the leading causes of death between high-income countries and the rest.

Expansion of transparency in the extractive industries, which began in the 1990s and has become mainstreamed in the decades since, has yielded tremendous results. $2.63 trillion in revenues has been disclosed by 54 countries through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), 77 datasets in open data format are maintained by the Natural Resource Governance Institute, and contracts between governments and extractive companies have been published in more than 40 countries—to name just a few examples.

However, there is much further to go. Disclosure of information such as contracts between governments and companies, the amount of taxes paid to governments by companies, the social impacts of resource extraction, and much more are not yet universal. Where they are disclosed, they are often far from comprehensive. To advance transparency and accountability in the sector, further work is needed to make extractives data widely available and usable.
For extractives data to have an impact, it should exist in an easily accessible and usable open data format that can be adopted by so-called “infomediaries”—civil society organizations and journalists. That allows infomediaries to translate this technical information for the public. Members of the public can then, if they have the ability, capacity, and the will, turn information into action.
This (admittedly oversimplified) path from open data to meaningful accountability is far from linear, but we know it can work: The open data movement has enabled the effective use of extractives data by civil society organizations, journalists, governments, and the public in many countries around the world.
Here, we examine illustrative examples of extractives data use along the natural resource value chain in three countries, and highlight the lessons that can be learned by all those seeking to turn disclosures into impact.
Indonesia
Indonesia’s extractive sector has experienced explosive growth since the 1980s, with the production of coal alone rising more than a thousand–fold in three decades. As mineral and coal extraction boomed in the 2000s and early 2010s, however, regulations faltered and failed to keep up with the pace of development. Provincial leaders handed out thousands of mining licenses to large and small operators alike, often without due diligence and verification, and sometimes in exchange for cash or political favors. As the mining boom slowed in the mid-2010s, environmental degradation became evident, and as the developmental benefits of mining remained irregular at best, Indonesia began to reassess its extractive policies.
Extractives data has proven to be an asset for Indonesia in crafting stronger, more efficient, and more equitable policies governing its extractive sector. The civil society organization Publish What You Pay (PWYP) cross-referenced data on mining licenses with spatial data to assess whether licensees were operating where they were supposed to be, finding that over 200,000 hectares were likely home to unlicensed mining operations. (The original report is available in Indonesian on Publish What You Pay’s website here.) These findings then helped convince Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to improve the governance of Indonesian mining.

A master class in corruption: The Luanda Leaks across the natural resource value chain

All told, Indonesia has used extractive licensing data in conjunction with economic and on-the-ground analysis to report some 6,000 suspicious or fraudulent (not “clean and clear”) mining licenses, of 11,000 total mining licenses granted during the boom period.
In another instance, PWYP-Indonesia used mining project payment data to assess whether the governments of two resource-rich districts had used their resource wealth to enhance local development. Finding that development had not been fully realized, PWYP recommended changes in revenue allocation, with special attention paid to the provision of public services and to poverty alleviation.
Not only can such reports reduce the impact of corruption and bribery, but they can also provide civil society organizations, communities, and local governments recourse for reclaiming natural resource revenues to promote equitable development at the local level.
Currently, Publish What You Pay and other civil society organizations in Indonesia are encouraging the implementation of a map policy to avoid overlap on licensees’ spatial maps, and a data policy (integrated in open data format) to allow for more effective oversight and ensure the benefits of resource extraction for Indonesia’s citizens.
Ghana
Ghana’s history of resource extraction stretches back to the early days of colonization, when it was called, in turn, the Portuguese Gold Coast, the Dutch Gold Coast, and the British Gold Coast. Today, it is Africa’s largest producer of gold. In the past decade, the country has also become a producer of oil and gas, after decades of exploration led to the discovery of the Jubilee oil field in 2007; production began in 2010, and oil revenue now surpasses mining revenue in the country. Ghana was an early EITI adopter, becoming a candidate country in 2007, and was designated in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the EITI Standard in 2010.
Ghana’s status as an EITI-implementing country, coupled with its oil boom and robust civil society engagement on extractive issues, has led to notable achievements in the use of extractives data to promote better governance.
Ghana’s early EITI reports revealed that the country was receiving little in the way of taxes from the mining sector, from just $27 million in 2004 to $91 million in 2008. These numbers were caused by generous taxation terms given to mining companies allowing for companies to pay a sliding scale of gross revenues between 3% and 12%; however, the disclosures revealed that the rate rarely if ever went above the minimum 3%, and royalty and tax contributions did not increase along with commodity prices.
As a result of these disclosures, Ghanaian civil society—an active presence in the extractive sector—advocated for higher taxation of mining companies and for increased spending of mining revenues on social development programs. The subsequent 2010 amendment to the Mining Act raised the royalty rate to 5% and abolished the sliding scale. Between 2010 and 2011, the Ghanaian government’s mining revenues more than doubled, in large part due to these and other changes in the mining law.
Ghanaian civil society’s use of extractives data to spur policy change did not end there. As oil production increased in the country, so did concerns over revenue management in that sector; commercial development of the Jubilee oil field had been fast-tracked, and Ghana began production with no revenue management legal framework or independent regulation in place. However, thanks in large part to recommendations from civil society representatives, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act of 2011 advanced greater transparency in the oil sector.
In the oil sector, disclosure requirements, and EITI reports in particular, also proved of use in resource revenue management: The country’s 2011-2012 report found that there was no capital gains tax charged to one of the oil companies operating in the Jubilee field, though such transactions were taxable by law. The fiscal regime was subsequently changed to ensure that capital gains would be taxed in the future.
These successes, though notable, have not been a panacea: Ghana has nonetheless struggled to translate its resource wealth into broad-based economic development, and the pandemic has exacerbated this situation. As the country navigates an uncertain future and overlapping crises, transparent and timely disclosures in the natural resource sector will be more important than ever to gain a clear-eyed view of Ghana’s economic development.
Colombia
Two recent initiatives in Colombia seek to analyze and enhance the use of extractives data. These initiatives are tracking the use of royalties at the subnational level and strengthening the use of data by indigenous communities affected by mining projects, including data related to consultation processes.
Royalty payments can play a significant role in bolstering local development: Between 2012 and 2019, royalties provided US$17.7 billion for public investment in Colombia’s water and sanitation, housing, infrastructure, education, and more. Access to accurate, user-friendly data on royalties in the extractive industries is therefore important for understanding the extent of available funds and how those funds are being used.
In 2019, the Transparency and Accountability Initiative (TAI), Global Integrity, and the International Finance Corporation identified a set of challenges regarding the availability and use of royalties data in Colombia. For example, while data on royalties is available via multiple platforms in Colombia, the complexity of the royalties system, compounded by decentralized and non-interoperable platforms, makes it challenging to access and analyze the available data on royalty payments and corresponding development projects.
Gaps in data availability—including due to the large proportion of small-scale and informal mining—limit civil society organizations’ and governments’ abilities to assess the full picture of the mining sector and related royalties. The threat of corruption and role of armed groups in illegal mining also hamper effective data disclosure and use.
Based on the findings from this assessment, Transparencia por Colombia and the Akubadaura Lawyers Commission launched initiatives in 2019 to test approaches for strengthening extractives data use for increased transparency and accountability. While aspects of both initiatives have been delayed by COVID-19, progress is ongoing.
Transparencia por Colombia aims to better understand the linkages between royalties and development projects in Colombia by analyzing how royalties are allocated to projects by national and subnational authorities. The organization is working with partners in a civil society group for transparency in the extractives sector to improve transparency and accountability in the reform of the General System of Royalties. In addition, the organization will be working with 10 local partners across the country to track the use of royalties for development projects and in response to the COVID-19 emergency.
The Akubadaura Lawyers Commission, led by indigenous women, is analyzing the impact of royalty resources on indigenous communities and tracking consultation commitments for extractives projects. As noted by TAI, “prior consultation of indigenous groups affected by natural resource extraction is a fundamental right” but one that is “often disregarded in practice.” The Commission also seeks to use extractives data to support indigenous leaders in better advocating for legislative measures surrounding extractive projects that affect their communities.
Additional information on these efforts is expected from TAI and Global Integrity later this year.
Conclusion
The examples above illustrate many of the technical, bureaucratic, and political challenges that transparency, accountability, and natural resource governance champions face in their efforts to advance access to and use of extractives data. However, these efforts also demonstrate that progress toward transparency and accountability is possible across the natural resource value chain—including consultation, licensing, revenue collection and taxation, and expenditure—when civil society and government champions alike work to improve quality, accessibility, and use of extractives data to benefit communities.

In the late 19th century, chemist Harvey W. Wiley analyzed the health effects of processed foods, alerting the nation to how contaminated they were. His 50-year campaign led to the Food and Drugs Act, the Meat Inspection Act, and, eventually, our modern standards of food safety. But a reformer akin to Wiley would be stymied by the technology sector today. Many observers agree that it’s long past time to implement more regulation and oversight on the tech sector. Yet the practices of these companies are obscured to reporters, researchers and regulators. This information asymmetry between the technology companies and the public is among the biggest issues in technology policy.
Users themselves often have little window into the choices that tech companies make for them. Increasingly more of the web is bespoke: Your feeds, search results, followers, and friends are yours and yours alone. This is true offline, too, as algorithmic tools screen job applicants and provide personalized medical treatments. While there are advantages to these digital services, this personalization comes at a cost to transparency. Companies collect enormous volumes of data and feed them through computer programs to shape each user’s experience. These algorithms are hidden from view, so it is often impossible to know which parts of the digital world are shared.
And it’s not just users who are operating in the dark. Many of the practices of technology companies are also obscured to the government institutions that should be providing oversight. Yet it is impossible to govern algorithms with anecdotes, so this needs to change. Government agencies need to be able to access the datasets that drive the tech sector.
A cascade of news stories detailing bad data behavior on behalf of tech companies highlights the importance of allowing the government to get a better sense of how tech companies operate. Reporting has unveiled, for example, how creepily specific location tracking is consolidated by a data broker market, exposing the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. And this initial data collection has downstream consequences. Much of it fuels an advertising technology industry that enables gender and racial discrimination in housing and employment advertising, evaluates Airbnb and Grubhub interactions to assign secret consumer scores for individual customers, and fuels dangerous misinformation. The effects go far beyond the internet, as algorithms prioritize health care for white patients and perpetuate biases in hiring under the pseudoscientific guise of rigor.
Academics and newsrooms are working furiously to trace these patterns, but they typically are equipped only for narrow investigations, not sectoral reviews. And there is no guarantee that the companies in the press are the worst offenders—sometimes bad actors fly just under the radar. Conversely, in some cases, reporting may be overblown, drawing our attention and outrage to the wrong spaces. There is also little follow-up, since journalists and scholars aren’t equipped to reinvestigate the same issues over and over. Like Wiley, Upton Sinclair would be foiled if he were able to turn his investigative eye from the meatpacking industry to Silicon Valley—it’s hard to infiltrate the inside of a website.
What’s missing, then? Well, that would be the federal government.

It would be easy to blame the absence of regulatory oversight on the apathy and incompetence of the Trump administration. But these problems predated the current White House occupant and, without broader changes, will persist. This is because U.S. public institutions are disadvantaged by an enormous information asymmetry. They have neither the mandate nor the capacity to examine proprietary corporate data systems or to scrutinize the math behind the curtain.
Congressional Democrats seem aware of this quandary: The House Judiciary Committee’s laudable investigation of big technology companies netted more than 1.3 million documents from Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. This is progress, and the information revealed by the document dump is meaningful to the antitrust debate (as well as to ongoing administrative and civil investigations) around the big four tech companies.
However, the problems in big tech go beyond antitrust issues and beyond these four companies.

The 1.3 million documents, already enough to strain a congressional committee’s staff, are a drop in the bucket compared to the exabytes of data being created by the digital economy. Just as our individual experiences cannot reveal an algorithm’s inner workings, neither can the tech sector be fully understood by reading its emails.
To be clear, there are plenty of barriers to effective information sharing with the government.
Some tech companies, especially those whose business practices most merit oversight, will avoid revealing their practices formally in writing. (“Assume every document will become public[,]” reads internal Google guidance.) Further, tech executives themselves may not fully understand their own systems. Reading internal documents might reveal intentional malpractice, but the worst of tech is known only to a rumor mill of in-house data scientists. They know the results from database queries that never made it into a memo and the questions not to ask of their own data.
This is a problem for regulating the tech sector: The scraps of data that tech companies let fall from the table are not enough to govern with. Instead, government regulators need expanded access to the datasets and code that power today’s technology companies.
What regulatory changes need to take place in order for this to happen? It may mean expanding the authority of administrative subpoenas for corporate datasets. This would allow federal agencies to gain access to corporate data under certain circumstances, such as the credible suspicion of illegal activity. It would also be necessary to build data infrastructure and hire analysts so that regulatory agencies can securely store and analyze massive datasets. For this, there need to be mechanisms in place to ensure, to the extent possible, anonymity of personal data. There will also need to be clear firewalls between these oversight agencies and law enforcement agencies, much like there is for the U.S. Census Bureau.
This data-scientific investigative capacity will be necessary for technology regulators, like the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, or any agency created for consumer data protection. But this capacity isn’t just necessary for creating and enforcing new legal restrictions: Many agencies need to be able to access and analyze corporate data just to enforce the laws already on the books. Software has eaten the world, and most industries would be better understood through their data.
Analyzing data from the respective industries they regulate could help the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce fair employment practices, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate financial services, and Housing and Urban Development to fight housing discrimination. With this data, government researchers and outside scholars could also develop a more nuanced understanding of how technology affects markets and society, enabling a more robust national conversation on what behaviors to allow and what to proscribe.
Companies that already have ethical algorithmic practices should welcome this expanded oversight, for perhaps counterintuitive reasons. As it stands now, the market advantage tends to lie with companies that pay little attention to designing ethical digital products. It is expensive to design ethical algorithms, and without regulation, there is not much payoff. Building diverse and balanced datasets to develop models, testing exhaustively for robustness, and auditing the datasets for biased outcomes are all time-consuming tasks that can be done well only by experienced data scientists. Other than the satisfaction from being upright citizens, these companies don’t get much out of this work—sometimes a better product, but that can be hard to prove to clients and customers. And other times, fairness reduces profitability. An ethical technology company can publish a blog post on its “ethical artificial intelligence framework,” but so can literally every other company—an example of what AI Now Institute’s Meredith Whittaker has called “ethics theatre.”
But this dynamic flips in a market with competent regulatory investigations. There would be real consequences for deploying unfair and illegal systems if executive branch regulators could more easily discover and police bad behavior. The more upstanding tech companies will be rewarded for their investments as their less scrupulous competitors are investigated, prosecuted and fined. Over time, the worst companies can be driven out.
None of this can happen without resolving the information gap between the public and tech companies. Without data, existing regulatory policies risk becoming increasingly unenforceable as corporations digitize products and services. Any new oversight legislation will face the same challenge. After decades of largely unregulated technology services, it is clear that some companies are poisoning the digital well, and it is past time to find out which ones.

PART-TIME WORK BY GENDER

In their new paper, Isabel Sawhill and Katherine Guyot explore the evolution of working time in the U.S. and how that compares to other high-income countries, noting that Americans are working longer. They document what they call the “middle-class time squeeze,” brought about, they say, “mainly by the failure of many policies and practices surrounding work and family life to adapt to the rising need for families to have a second earner.” The chart above shows the fraction of the workforce in part-time work by gender. While in the U.S. the gap is smaller than most other developed nations, “women’s labor force participation is lower in the U.S. than in much of Western Europe and Scandinavia, perhaps because of fewer opportunities to work part-time.”
GENDER INEQUALITY IN NORTH AMERICA

In his paper for 19A: The Gender Equality Series, Richard Reeves writes that even 100 years after the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the “U.S. compares badly to most other countries in the world in terms of gender equality in politics—including to our nearest neighbors, Canada and Mexico.” All three countries, Reeves notes, have achieved gender equality in education and health; the U.S. and Canada lead Mexico in the economic arena; yet when it comes to political empowerment of women, Mexico leads both its North American neighbors.
Women overwhelmingly cite caregiving as reason for not working

Sawhill, Reeves, and Sarah Nzau find that female labor force participation has decreased in recent years [data pre-coronavirus], and many women cite their caring responsibilities for leaving the workforce. “One-third of the decrease in women’s employment in the U.S. relative to other advanced countries is related to the lack of benefits such as paid leave,” the authors note. “There are many women (and increasing numbers of men) who want to be able to combine a successful paid working life with engaged caring roles.”

More energy and power sector data is available in India than ever before, especially through a combination of websites and portals. We propose that issues in locating, procuring and acquiring data be ironed out for researchers and practitioners to conduct more evidence-based policy research and contribute to the national discourse. Researchers use energy and related data from a variety of government departments and ministries, but its synchronisation and accuracy vary across the respective departments, making the prescriptions subjective to the source of information used. Moreover, in the absence of critical data, researchers end up relying on rules-of-thumb passed down from year to year, with no basis for re-evaluating the underlying assumptions. This may lead to an unwarranted convergence in the outcomes of analyses, in that they may reinforce a bias against changing dynamics on the ground as they are unable to fully capture them.
At the same time, there is a spurt of public data in the form of models, portals and other initiatives by ministries, departments and enterprises in the public sector. While the necessity of quality control in the form of a centralised information management system in the energy sector has never been stronger than before, we realise it is a massive
institutional undertaking that requires a considerable amount of time to plan and implement. Therefore, we propose that as a first step, we have higher standards and consistency in the availability and reporting of public data on energy.
In the absence of critical data, researchers end up relying on rules of thumb passed down from year to year, with no basis for re-evaluating the underlying assumptions.
This note offers suggestions for owners of energy sector public data to update their methods and reporting so that the data they disseminate can be more meaningful to researchers and other stakeholders for evidence-based analysis.
A number of new initiatives have been taken in the form of online government portals, including some that give real-time data on demand-supply, access, distribution and infrastructure, such as the NITI Aayog’s India Energy Dashboards, GARV Dashboard, MERIT, URJA, UJALA, GARV, GTG India, etc. Each of these focusses on specific aspects: from a generalised view on energy demand and supply and its constituents, to performance of DISCOMS, to status on electrification and
household access, to disbursal of energy efficient lighting, to more technical aspects of financial and operating performance of power plants and renewable integration.
The spurt in the reporting of such data to supplement traditional reports (often annual) from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Ministry of Coal (MoC), Coal Controller’s Office (CCO), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) etc. is necessary, useful and welcome in analysing past and current performance and coming up with evidence-based policy research. This can be further improved with some standardisation and offering choices to the user to customise the data, unpack the assumptions and study trends.

India’s renewable energy targets in context: Ambitious yet the new normal?

We have attempted to highlight some suggestions for improving data dissemination, and assess how some of these can be incorporated in the ongoing efforts. We also give examples of websites/data compilations already following the particular suggestion/s.
Suggestions for improving data dissemination:
1. Make data available for downloading
Several dashboards have great data but are geared towards online visualisations. Downloading allows researchers and other stakeholders to undertake their own efforts in analysis and visualisation, reducing the effort on data owners to try and “show it all”.
Examples: PPAC’s Oil and Gas Marketing Data, NITI Aayog’s India Energy Portal
2. Provide historical data (as best available)
Several dashboards give great data but are limited to a few days or months. It would help to have archives available online. As of now, some scholars and institutions run scraping tools to get data regularly. This is a step that can lead to errors and is avoidable by providing archived data. The use of archives also allows historical data to reflect any corrections/updates, which instantaneous data may not capture properly.
Examples: MoSPI’s Energy Statistics, CCO’s Coal Statistics, MoPNG’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Statistics
3. Enable long-term archiving with appropriate nomenclature
Online repositories should standardise nomenclature of data sets, files, etc. to enable easy identification and differentiation. Instead of calling a file “ouput.xls” or “Annual_Report.pdf” it would help to have these segmented into folders and have names such as“load_ouput_20.09.17” or “Annual_Report_2016”. This is particularly important because when a researcher lists an Annual Report as a reference in a study, the web address may lead to a different version of the Annual Report.
Examples: CEA’s Load Generation and Balancing Reports, MoSPI’s annual publications
4. Make data available in the right format(s)
i) There are two parts to this. In some cases, there is no download available, and so just having HTML data is difficult to work with. There can be good visualisations online, but downloadable data is amenable for analysis. Second, where data are available for download, they should be more than PDFs. In fact, some PDFs are images,
despite the underlying data being generated in numerical/database/excel format. Excel formats are a neutral mode, since databases can be proprietary.
ii) A good starting point, especially in case of online portals, would be to archive data in the periodicity chosen into downloadable excel sheets. This will supplement (i) and enable more granular analysis.
iii) Where hard copies are available, have soft copies available as well, which avoids printing and mailing costs. Data providers can continue to charge for such data as required, but in the long run, all public data should be available online and free.
Examples: PPAC’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Price Statistics, NITI’s India Energy Portal
5. Give multiple options and end-user-controlled user interfaces for visualisations
To complement real-time visualisations, which likely will be data-owner driven, having a set of choices for data visualisation will help users. Examples range from the ability to choose time periods, locations, granularity, show comparisons, etc.
Example: NREL and MoP’s Greening the Grid
6. Clarify/Standardise/Improve the headings and meta-data
i) This starts with having units properly listed, but extends to making formulae transparent when numbers are shown. CEA does this in places, where they show, for example, column P = [F – G]/B. In the long run, we suggest standardisation of headings, even to the extent of .xml schemas. We (as scholars/researchers) can help the government with such an exercise.
ii) Several times researchers have to compare between different sources to obtain a sense of the information that is being conveyed. In case of MoSPI and CEA data on electricity generation, the scope of the exercise (whether captive generation is included in the numbers or auxiliary consumption is netted out) is unclear to compare and
it can at best be inferred that the higher numbers in one case include captive generation. Even so, it is highly likely that it does not get fully accounted. With the spurt of new data in the public domain, we should be careful to ensure there is no difference between what we intend to convey and what we end up conveying. Such standardisation must be an integral part of the data maintenance protocol on new data sources such as tools and dashboards.
Example: CEA’s General Reviews
7. Be transparent in data sources and references
i) This not only helps in tracking down primary data and sources, but even to link to underlying methodologies. A weblink is an ideal reference, except in the case where a link may not be available. In both cases, detailed information is helpful. For example, instead of just saying “Source: CEA” it would be helpful to explicitly state which CEA report or document was the source.
ii) References are especially important for webpages, online reports, etc. This is sometimes done, but often the presentations by staff/officers found online lack this information.
Example: NITI’s India Energy Portal
8. Share methodologies and assumptions
i) To the extent possible, through a note or additional explanation, clarify relevant assumptions and methodologies. For example:
(1) Is the number for gross or net?
(2) Where is this number calculated (for what location or node)? At the unit, plant, bus-bar, boundary meter, etc.?
(3) Is a particular number instrumented, reported, or calculated via some methodology?
(4) As an example, for stating power shortfall, it should be specified if it is instrumented or calculated.
ii) This is particularly important for sources that intend to convey a systems perspective (especially models and tools) or draw from multiple assumptions (empirical, thumb-rules, etc.). This should be clarified and stated upfront, along with the units of analyses, any rounding off, etc. For example, it would help if NITI’s Energy Dashboard also provided a basis for arriving at consumer category-wise connected load.
In relation to (4) above, the methodology and nomenclature should also be standardised across the board. So the Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) and Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses reported in MoSPI and CEA should conform to their strict definitions to enable comparisons.
Example: NITI’s India Energy Security Scenarios
9. Give a date for all materials {both dissemination date and relevant data period date(s)}
i) For reports and data sets, the date of release and the date of underlying data are both helpful. For presentations and reports, date is important as the material presented otherwise can lack context. This is particularly useful for archived data.
ii) Sometimes, presentations made by government officials at various forums are made available online. These often contain previously unpublished data but nevertheless can be traced to a credible source. These sources should be accompanied with dates so that it becomes easier to use them for analysis.
Example: Indiastat
10. List a point of contact for data queries
There should be a means to contact someone (who may or may not be the data “owner”) for clarifications and queries.
Examples: NITI’s India Energy Security Scenarios and India Energy Portal

India has no central body for maintaining and disseminating energy data, let alone analysing it. We propose the creation of a national Energy Information Agency to replace the current patchwork of systems. This would collect, standardize and analyse data across energy domains and make it publicly available.
A lack of robust data sets has hampered India’s energy research, undermining policy and regulatory compliance. Data from different bodies, some statutory, are often reported as gross averages and lack timeliness; they may be incomplete and vary in accuracy, and depend on different methodologies and assumptions.
A central Energy Information Agency should coordinate with existing data holders, such as the Central Electricity Authority and the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, and with state and private industry. This would encourage the development of new business models and other innovations (see, for example, E. Funkhouser et al. Energy Res. Soc. Sci. 10, 90–101; 2015).
The agency would help India to expand its energy infrastructure and to improve the availability, affordability and reliability of its energy supply. Frameworks for measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) are also key to honouring India’s commitments under the Paris climate deal.

146,/article/idUSL4N2CW1KK,Delayed survey data blurs India's coronavirus picture,"By Devjyot Ghoshal4 Min ReadNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has lost two weeks in its bid to get a picture of the spread of the coronavirus in its population because of poor Chinese testing kits, a member of a national task force said, complicating a decision on opening up from a lockdown.A policeman stands past migrant workers and their families waiting for transport to reach to a railway station to board trains to their home states, after a limited reopening of India's giant rail network following a nearly seven-week lockdown to slow the spreading of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Ahmedabad, India, May 15, 2020. REUTERS/Amit DaveThe kits were for antibodies to the virus, meaning authorities could determine who had been exposed to it as part of a broad survey to assess its spread.But hundreds of thousands of kits had to be returned to China after inconsistent results, and the government does not have all of the data it should have to decide on how and when to loosen the lockdown, first imposed on March 25.“We would have known the extent of infections, how much is the spread, about two weeks back. The delay is about two weeks,” Dr Manoj Murhekar, a task force member and director of the National Institute of Epidemiology, told Reuters on Thursday.A survey of 24,000 people was now underway with indigenously developed test kits and data would be available by the end of May, he said.Two members of a research group advising the government said the delay caused by the inconsistent Chinese kits was longer than two weeks.Two other members of the group said another factor that has hindered the collection of the data is that health authorities have been more focused on testing high-risk groups and containment, and slow in efforts to mount systematic surveillance.“Without surveillance data, you are really flying blind,” one of the members said.All four experts declined to be identified, some citing a government rule not allowing public comment.The health ministry said this week systematic surveillance was starting in selected districts.It did not respond to queries from Reuters.China criticised India’s complaint about the kits as unfair and irresponsible, and said the tests needed to be carried out in a professional manner to produce accurate results.‘GREEN’ AREAS ARE KEY Data from the survey across 60 districts will help authorities better understand the spread and concentration of infections and improve the response, the research group members said.India’s cases of coronavirus reached 81,970 on Friday, with its tally likely to surpass that of China, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, later in the day.More cases are expected as the government eases the stay-at-home restrictions on the 1.3 billion population.To conduct the survey, India’s more than 700 districts will be divided into four groups depending on the number of confirmed cases, and 15 will be selected from each category, one of the members said.Then, tests will be conducted in clusters, with 400 people from each of the 60 districts tested.The survey should provide data that can be used to track the disease’s trajectory over time in a given area, or used to compare one area’s situation to another.“This is the first thing you’re supposed to do,” one of the research group members said.Murhekar said the data should show the spread of the virus, particularly in “green zones” - areas with no confirmed cases or none for 28 days - under the government’s colour-coding system.“The main advantage would been in green areas. Are they really green?” Murhekar said.After the 60 districts are surveyed, another 10 cities with the most number of infections would be assessed, he said.While authorities await the delayed data, Murhekar said they still had the results from India’s tally of about 2 million people tested to categorise districts.“It is not that we absolutely do not know anything about the transmission of the disease,” he said.Reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani, Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications has opened a new data center in Singapore, its first in Southeast Asia, it said on Tuesday.Use of Zoom’s video conferencing services has surged as huge numbers of people across the world work from home because of coronavirus curbs, but the company has also come under fire over privacy and security issues.The Singapore data center, through which the company’s users in Southeast Asia can connect, brings its total to 18 sites globally.The company also plans to hire more Singapore employees, including engineers and sales staff, said Abe Smith, Head of International at Zoom.Security researchers this year discovered that Zoom rerouted some calls through its servers in China, even if those calls were placed outside China.The company had said that this took place in “extremely limited circumstances” and it had taken its mainland China data centres off an approved list of back-ups for users outside China.Zoom’s Smith said there has been a 65-fold increase in users of its free services in Singapore, with a tripling of paying customers, since January. Since March, 400 schools in the city state have been using the platform.Singapore briefly suspended the use of Zoom by teachers in April after “very serious incidents” in the first week of coronavirus lockdown, including an incident that involved obscene images appearing on screens during a geography lesson.Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by David GoodmanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/ Mike Blake(Reuters) - Semiconductor firm Nvidia Corp on Thursday announced a new chip that can be digitally split up to run several different programs on one physical chip, a first for the company that matches a key capability on many of Intel Corp’s chips.The notion behind what the Santa Clara, California-based company calls its A100 chip is simple: Help the owners of data centers get every bit of computing power possible out of the physical chips they purchase by ensuring the chip never sits idle. The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business.When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com or Microsoft Corp for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a “virtual machine.”Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.But the technology has been mostly limited to processor chips from Intel and similar chips such as those from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia said Thursday that its new A100 chip can be split into seven “instances.”For Nvida, that solves a practical problem. Nvidia sells chips for artificial intelligence tasks. The market for those chips breaks into two parts. “Training” requires a powerful chip to, for example, analyze millions of images to train an algorithm to recognize faces. But once the algorithm is trained, “inference” tasks need only a fraction of the computing power to scan a single image and spot a face.Nvidia is hoping the A100 can replace both, being used as a big single chip for training and split into smaller inference chips.Customers who want to test the theory will pay a steep price of $200,000 for Nvidia’s DGX server built around the A100 chips. In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang argued the math will work in Nvidia’s favor, saying the computing power in the DGX A100 was equal to that of 75 traditional servers that would cost $5,000 each.“Because it’s fungible, you don’t have to buy all these different types of servers.

Utilization will be higher,” he said. “You’ve got 75 times the performance of a $5,000 server, and you don’t have to buy all the cables.”Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Its recent interventions have been wars of choice; NATO led the intervention in Afghanistan and helped defeat Slobodan Milosevic’s regime in Yugoslavia. Yet one of NATO's founding principles was that of collective self-defence, embodied in the crucial fifth clause of the 1949 Washington Treaty. It says that “an armed attack on one or more [members] shall be considered an attack on all” and that members will assist the victim(s) of such an attack “forthwith”. Article 5 seemed something of an anachronism after the Soviet collapse. Now, as Russia boosts its defence spending, carries out dummy nuclear attacks on neighbours, and calls snap military exercises on the border with the Baltic states, it is relevant once again. But what does Article 5 actually require of NATO allies, and would they follow through in a pinch?"

All that said, I am not as up in arms as some about President Trump’s refusal to explicitly endorse Article 5 in his speech on May 25 in Brussels. That choice was regrettable—but it was also a relatively minor mistake, in my eyes, and not without some understandable basis.
For one thing, if you read Article 5, it actually entails a bit more ambiguity than some tend to remember. Here it is, in its entirety, from the 1949 Washington Treaty that created the cornerstone of NATO:
“The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.”
Note the phrasing “…such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force…” The second part of that phrase makes it sound as if a military response should be axiomatic and immediate. But the first part guards the sovereign right of each country to make its own decision, based on the specifics of a given situation.

The ambiguity is inevitable, because no one can foresee all contingencies, and the way NATO should respond to one threat is necessarily different from how it should respond to another. Even if Trump had fully endorsed it, it would not automatically commit the United States to any particular course of action in the event of, say, another Russian cyberattack on Estonia, or a use of Russian “little green men” to seize some remote border town in eastern Latvia. The words of Article 5 are no silver bullet.
The words of Article 5 are no silver bullet.
Also, in this business, actions speak louder than words—and we still have thousands of U.S. troops undergirding our commitment to Poland and the Baltic states, among other forward regions. Trump hasn’t suggested pulling these forces back.
Also, there is other reassurance—Trump’s statement that NATO is no longer obsolete, his administration’s maintenance of sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, assurances from the rest of his top national security team underscoring our resoluteness to defend NATO—that things aren’t nearly as bad as I feared they might be when listening to then-candidate Trump. The Trump administration has reaffirmed American obligations and sustained American foreign policy in Europe in most ways.
So, while I would have preferred that he fully support Article 5—and voice that—I don’t expect to lose sleep over it. And if a few European friends do lose a little sleep over it (and thereby consider stepping up their burden-sharing a bit), the outcome won’t be all bad.

The Brussels mini-summit is supposed to affirm the relevance of the alliance in the Trump era but there is a risk that it could severely undermine it. President Trump is the only American president since NATO’s founding who has not explicitly endorsed Article 5. His vice president and his secretary of defense have but he has not. If he fails to do so in Brussels, it could raise grave doubts about the credibility of the American security guarantee and provide Russia with an incentive to probe vulnerable Baltic states.
President Trump’s reticence on Article 5 has been largely overlooked because of his recent remark that NATO is no longer obsolete. But, a close reading of Trump’s statements reveal that his policy shift is much smaller than it appeared at the time.
President Trump is the only American president since NATO’s founding who has not explicitly endorsed Article 5.
Donald Trump’s first major statement about NATO came in March 2016 in an interview with The New York Times. He said the alliance was obsolete for several reasons. The first was that Russia no longer posed the threat the Soviet Union did. The second is that NATO was not focused on counterterrorism. The third is the financial cost of NATO to the United States.
In the year that followed, Trump doubled down on this critique, particularly on terrorism and burden-sharing. He repeatedly argued that NATO members must pay up if they were to receive U.S. protection. In July 2016, he said, I want to keep NATO but I want them to pay. I don’t want to be taken advantage of…We’re protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never even heard of and we end up in world war three…Give me a break.”

Order from Chaos
The quiet reformation of Biden’s foreign policy

Thomas Wright
Friday, March 20, 2020







After taking office Trump claimed credit for a shift on burden sharing and counterterrorism. He told a joint session of Congress that the “money is pouring in. Very nice.” When he met the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in April, he said: “I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change — and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete.”
The crucial nuance is that Trump did not say that NATO’s original mission of countering Russian power in Europe is no longer obsolete. Indeed, he has never acknowledged this. The closest he has come is a general statement of strong support with caveats attached for burden sharing and counterterrorism. Trump’s failure to endorse Article 5 is not an oversight. Members of his cabinet have unsuccessfully tried to insert this language into his remarks, including at his meeting with Stoltenberg.
Compare this with Trump’s predecessor. President Obama went to Estonia in 2013 and said:
“I say to the people of Estonia and the people of the Baltics, today we are bound by our treaty Alliance. We have a solemn duty to each other. Article 5 is crystal clear: An attack on one is an attack on all. So if, in such a moment, you ever ask again, ‘who will come to help,’ you’ll know the answer—the NATO Alliance, including the Armed Forces of the United States of America.”
One can criticize President Obama’s Russia policy but he understood the sacred importance of Article 5.
Others in the administration have attempted to compensate for the president’s reticence. Secretary Mattis and Vice President Pence explicitly endorsed Article V of the NATO Treaty at the Munich Security Conference in February of this year. Mattis called it a “bedrock commitment.” Pence said it is “one of two core principles that are central to” NATO’s mission and that U.S. support for the alliance is “unwavering.”
Mattis and Pence have helped bolster U.S. credibility on NATO as has the continuing deployment of U.S. forces and assets to Eastern Europe which began under the Obama administration. But ultimately the decision to uphold U.S. commitments lies with the commander-in-chief.  He alone decides whether and how the United States will respond to a Russian attack on a NATO member.
President Trump needs to state his support for NATO’s original mission and America’s solemn commitments if the alliance is to be as effective in the future as it has been in the past. Trump has already moderated his position on U.S. alliances. When he stands beside a piece of the wreckage of the World Trade Center, he should complete his journey and say what every postwar president has said—the United States will stand by its allies in NATO by honoring its commitments under Article 5.

167,https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/indiaspend-article-cites-study-on-indias-coal-requirement-by-2020/,IndiaSpend article cites study on “India’s coal requirement by 2020”,"


An IndiaSpend article on 8 September 2016 quotes the Brookings India report titled “Coal Requirement in 2020: A Bottom-up Analysis“, which indicates that even by a generous estimate, the country’s need for coal will not exceed 1.2 billion tonnes over the next four years, as opposed to the Government of India target of 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020.
The article shows how the report calculates India’s future coal requirement:
How much coal will we actually need by 2020?
To estimate India’s coal needs after six years, the Brookings report focuses on three sets of data:
1. Base growth rate: In this case, the report analysed two different scenarios:
a) Scenario 1: Non-power-sector demand was extrapolated based on gross domestic product (GDP) and assumptions were made that demand and production would be elastic–responsiveness of production to rise in demand and prices. Power demand was calculated on upcoming thermal power capacity (examining all plants under construction, their locations, technology, and status, assuming a similar plant load factor (PLF)—or the capacity utilisation of a power plant–as in financial year (FY)’14-15.  Assumptions for the non-power sector include the following: 8 per cent GDP growth, respective sectoral GDP changes due to supply and demand and continued imports proportionate to imports in the base year FY’14-15. This scenario puts the estimate at 1,311 MT.
b) Scenario 2: The non-power-sector demand was kept the same as scenario 1. A power-demand calculation was made assuming i) no power cuts by 2020 b) electrification to unconnected rural consumers and reduction in distribution losses. This scenario pegs the estimate at 1228 MT, a more realistic figure, as per the report.
2. High Coal: This method, which pegs India’s coal requirement at 1,291 MT, is optimistic and assumes no imports of thermal coal (coking coal–used to primarily manufacture steel–imports, however, are assumed to continue), a high GDP growth of 8 per cent, 100 per cent electrification with no power cuts, and a modest growth of renewable energy. The assumption is that renewable energy does not displace coal very much as a source of power generation.
Although the health costs to India of using coal to generate electricity are about $4.6 billion (Rs 29,400 crore) annually, which is the cost of setting up five power plants of 1,000 mega watts (MW) each, or 2% of India’s installed capacity, every year, India may have little option but to focus on coal as the primary source of electricity, with the need for coal-fired electricity estimated to increase three times by 2030, as IndiaSpend reported in May 2015.
Coal generates over 75 per cent of India’s electricity and is among the cheapest energy sources available. But its main advantage over other feasible alternatives is that it is largely immune to interference from nature—quakes, floods, droughts—economic vagaries and artificial accidents.
3. Low Coal: This scenario assumes a partial improvement in supply quality with imports in the same proportion as in FY ‘14-‘15, and pegs the requirement at 1,139 MT.

Why are the targets too ambitious?
Today, about 45 MT of India’s coal production (7.4 per cent of coal production of India in FY ‘14-15) comes from private miners. Achieving the government target of 500 MT by 2020 would require an unprecedented 11 times growth or a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61 per cent in the private sector.
If CIL and the other mining PSUs are to reach the 1-billion-tonne target, they will need to grow at an aggregated 12 per cent CAGR. If the growth target is limited to just CIL, then the company’s CAGR will stand at 15 per cent. The report notes that although CIL did achieve 8.5 per cent year-on-year growth in FY’15-16–its best ever–it still missed its target by 12 MT, settling for 538 MT in the last fiscal.

The 12 per cent growth for CIL then seems unlikely, especially in the future over a larger base. A 12 per cent growth on a 500 base (production around 500 MT mark)–CIL produced 538 MT in 2015-16–is easier than on an 800 base (production around 800 MT), which means CIL must produce more than 800 million tonnes in the future.

The two do not have a free-trade agreement (FTA), owing in part to India’s protectionist approach and a lack of political appetite in the U.S.
“U.S. goods exports to India have grown only 22 percent since 2008, and other trade indicators, including in services are not impressive. Indian exports have not grown in the past two years despite a much healthier economic outlook,” Jaishankar flagged.

The July 27, 2014 edition of the New York Times Sunday Magazine featured an article by Elizabeth Green entitled “Why Do Americans Stink at Math?” In this blog post, I identify six myths promulgated in that article.  Let me be clear at the outset.  I am an admirer of Elizabeth Green’s journalism and am sympathetic to the idea that improving teaching would raise American math achievement.  But this article is completely off base.  Its most glaring mistake is giving the impression that a particular approach to mathematics instruction—referred to over the past half-century as “progressive,” “constructivist,” “discovery,” or “inquiry-based”—is the answer to improving mathematics learning in the U.S.  That belief is not supported by evidence.

A Summary

Freedom of Religion—protected in America for two hundred years by the Bill of Rights—has become more a source of divisiveness than the binding force it used to be in American life. Abortion, school prayer, creation science, and secular humanism are a few examples of the conflict between religious liberty and public justice that arise today.
 Articles of Faith, Articles of Peace examines the contemporary challenges to religious liberty and explores ways in which the public philosophy can be reinvigorated. Steering between the extremes of a “sacred public square,” in which any one faith is established or preferred, and a “naked public square,” from which all faiths have been removed, the authors argue for, and exemplify, a civil public square. And they try to answer the vital question: how do we, in an age of expanding worldwide pluralism, live with our deepest, religiously intense, differences.
Peter L. Berger, Harold J. Berman, Os Guinness, James Davidson Hunter, William Lee Miller, Michael J. Sandel, and Charles Taylor are the distinguished contributors to this book who speak from different academic disciplines and diverse personal perspectives. Their concerns converge in this dynamic and thought-provoking discussion important to every American. The authors acknowledge that American pluralism has grown beyond the traditional “Protestant-Catholic-Jew” into a genuine multifaith pluralism, and that religious liberty entails the freedom to dissent as well as to believe.
 Articles of Faith, Articles of Peace is a proposal and discussion that carries great promise for the pressing problems of religion in American public life. The vision of a civil public square, and a common goal for common good, offers a way for American diversity to remain a source of strength and richness. Only with such commitments will democratic debate remain robust and religious liberty remain a component of a vital democracy.

171,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/01/19/the-right-to-choose-to-wear-or-not-hijab/,The right to choose to wear (or not) hijab,"
Muslims need to be able to freely and openly debate the headscarf, or hijab. It’s certainly true, as Asra Nomani argues, that the idealization of hijab can put women who choose not to wear it in a challenging position. So, yes, speaking as a Muslim-American, if I had a daughter, I’d want her to be able to not cover her hair and not have to worry about being judged by her peers as somehow less religious or “chaste.” But this doesn’t change the fact that just as women should be free and empowered to choose not to wear hijab, they must also be free and empowered to wear it, if that’s what they want.
This is why it’s hard for me to understand why we need to put quotes around the word “choice.” Here in the United States, every single hijabi woman I know has chosen to wear it voluntarily, sometimes to the dismay, or even outright opposition, of friends and family. While there are countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran where hijab is mandated, in countries like, say, Turkey or Morocco, there’s no evidence I’ve seen that suggests that a large number of women are forced against their will to wear the headscarf by a parent or spouse. So it really depends on which countries we’re talking about. (Of course, in those cases where women are forced by their families, communities and civil society organizations, whether in Western or Muslim-majority countries, should speak out unequivocally and take action).
[J]ust as Muslims have the right to argue that the hijab is not religiously mandated, they should also have the right to argue that it is religiously mandated.
If Nomani and Hala Arafa’s Washington Post article was merely offering the view that the headscarf isn’t Islamically mandated, then that’s great. (It goes both ways though: just as Muslims have the right to argue that the hijab is not religiously mandated, they should also have the right to argue that it is religiously mandated).Muslims need to feel comfortable debating sensitive issues like this in public forums. I certainly agree with Nomani that people shouldn’t feel afraid to object to the notion that hijab is fard (obligatory). This, though, doesn’t mean casting the choices of the hundreds of millions of women who have worn the headscarf as somehow invalid, irrational, wrong, or backwards. In her post here, Nomani argues for example that the headscarf is a symbol of a “dangerous purity culture, obsessed with honor and virginity.” This would seem to suggest that anyone who chooses to wear it is somehow encouraging “a dangerous purity culture, obsessed with honor and virginity.”
Just as conservatives argue that the opinion that hijab is not obligatory is simply illegitimate and worthy of scorn, we need to be careful about doing the reverse. Nomani and Arafa write that “in exploring the ‘hijab,’ [those in universities and the media] are not exploring Islam, but rather the ideology of political Islam as practiced by the mullahs, or clerics, of Iran and Saudi Arabia, the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State.” This is not quite correct. For better or worse, all four Sunni madhabs (schools of law) consider covering the hair to be obligatory by ijma’, or consensus, regardless of geographic context. We don’t have to like this (and perhaps one day there will be more dissenting voices like Khaled Abou El Fadl), but we can’t ignore or dismiss it either. Legal debates aside, there are endless millions of Muslim women who believe that covering their hair is religiously mandated, so, for them, it is inextricably tied to Islam and to their own personal relationship to God. To insist otherwise is to deny the agency, autonomy, and choice of these Muslim women.
I also have some concerns about how Nomani and Arafa link the wearing of the headscarf to the rise of Islamism. The idea that the hijab is some modern Islamist creation is not correct. While it is true that majorities of women, particularly in urban centers, did not cover their hair in the 1950s or 60s, it is more accurate to see this several decades-long period, during the heyday of secular Arab nationalism, as exceptional in the broader sweep of history. For instance, in the pre-modern era, the vast majority of women covered their hair throughout the Middle East (and even this may be an understatement).

I discuss this at length in my book Temptations of Power, but here a few relevant data points. In Jordan, the “secular” government started getting religion – by, for example, incorporating the religious obligation of zakat into the tax system and Islamizing television programming – before there was a single Islamist in parliament. One of the most ambitious efforts in recent decades to reconcile national law with sharia occurred under the “secular” President Anwar el-Sadat when the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt controlled less than 1 percent of parliament. Sadat’s sharia committees receive little attention, but it’s a fascinating episode in recent Egyptian history. In short, much of the Islamic revival of 1970s and 80s was grassroots and organic (as evidenced by the fact that, even where Saudi Arabia’s influence was marginal, as in Turkey, we see similar trends). With democratic openings in Jordan and Egypt in the 1980s, Islamist parties could ride society’s growing religiosity to electoral success. What this means is that the initial rise of Islamist parties was more the consequence rather than the cause of the Arab religious revival.
Meanwhile, in Egypt today, some of the most vociferous anti-Islamist voices – many of whom self-define as “liberal” – wear the headscarf and do so proudly. I imagine they’d find being called instruments of Islamism somewhat odd. 
It is also worth noting that just as headscarf can be forced, so too can not wearing it. Tunisia and Turkey saw decades of forced secularization, where the headscarf was not only stigmatized and belittled as backwards but also even banned in state and public institutions. Presumably, the many women who still chose to wear the headscarf in these circumstances were doing so at considerable risk. In Tunisia, to wear the hijab meant to put yourself under suspicion of being a member or supporter of the then-banned Islamist movement, Ennahda. (Few have made the argument that hijab is an Islamist creation with more enthusiasm than certain secular dictatorships). Up until just a couple years ago, wearing the headscarf in Turkey meant that you couldn’t go to university in your own country or work as a doctor in a state hospital. Despite this, large numbers, and even majorities, chose to cover their hair.

Finally, there is a way of phrasing and framing the debate that I think we would all do well to avoid. For example, Nomani and Arafa write about growing up “in modern Muslim families.” This, again, would seem to suggest that women who choose to cover their hair are somehow less modern. What, I would ask, is intrinsically “modern” about not covering one’s hair?

172,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/optimal-solar-subsidy-policy-design-and-incentive-pass-through-evaluation-using-us-california-as-an-example/,Optimal solar subsidy policy design and incentive pass-through evaluation: using US California as an example,"
Renewable energy is an important source to tackle against climate change, as the latest IPCC report has pointed out. However, due to the existence of multiple market failures such as negative externalities of fossil fuels and knowledge spillovers of new technology, government subsidies are still needed to develop renewable energy, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. In the United States, there have been various forms of subsidies for PV, varying from the federal level to the state level, and from the city level to the utility level. California, as the pioneer of solar PV development, has put forward the biggest state-level subsidy program for PV, the California Solar Initiative (CSI). The CSI has planned to spend around $2.2 Billion in 2007–2016 to install roughly 2 GW PV capacity, with the average subsidy level as high as $1.1/W. How to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and incentive pass-through of this program are the two major research questions we are pursing. 
Our cost-effectiveness analysis is based on a constrained optimization model that we developed, where the objective is to install as much PV capacity as possible under a fixed budget constraint. Both the analytical and computational results suggest that due to a strong peer effect and the learning-by-doing effect, one can shift subsides from later periods to early periods so that the final PV installed capacity can be increased by 8.1% (or 32 MW). However, if the decision-maker has other policy objectives or constraints in mind, such as maintaining the policy certainty, then, the optimally calculated subsidy policy would look like the CSI. 
As to the incentive pass-through question, we took a structural approach and in addition used the method of regression discontinuity (RD). While in general, the incentive pass-through rate depends on the curvature of the demand and supply curve and the level of market competition, our two estimations indicate that the incentive pass-through for the CSI program is almost complete. In other words, almost all of the incentive has been enjoyed by the customer, and the PV installers did not retain much. Based on the RD design, we observe that PV installers tend to consider the CSI incentive as exogenous to their pricing decision. 
The relative good performance of the CSI in terms of both the cost-effectiveness and the incentive pass-through aspect are tightly related to its policy design and program management. International speaking, the biggest challenge for the design of any PV subsidy program is the quick running out of the budget, and in the end, it looks like customers are rushing for the subsidy. Such rushing behavior is a clear indication of higher-than-needed incentive levels. Due to the policy rigidity and rapid PV technological change, the PV subsidy policy may lag behind the PV cost decline; and as a result, rational customers could rush for any unnecessarily high subsidy. 
Due to the high uncertainty and unpredictability of future PV costs, the CSI put forward a new design that links the incentive level change and the installed capacity goal fulfillment. Specifically, the CSI has designed nine steps to achieve its policy goal; at each step, there is a PV capacity goal that corresponds to an incentive level. Once the capacity goal is finished, the incentive level will decrease to the next lower level. Furthermore, to maintain the policy certainty, the CSI regulated that every step-wise change in the incentive level should not be higher than $0.45/W, nor smaller than $0.05/W, together with other three constraints. 
A good subsidy policy not only requires flexible policy design to respond to fast-changing environment, but also demands an efficient program management system, digitalized if possible. For the CSI, the authority has contracted out a third-party to maintain a good database system for the program. Specifically, the database has documented in detail every PV system that customers requested. Key data fields include 22 important dates during the PV installation process, customers’ zip code, city, utility and county information, and various characteristics of the PV system such as price, system size, incentive, PV module and installer. All information is publicly available, which to some extent fills in the information gap held by customers and fosters the market competition among PV installers. For customers to receive the incentive, their PV systems have to pass the inspection of the local government, and also to be interconnected to the grid. On the supply side, the CSI has also certified and created a list of PV installers that every customer can choose from. 
Although the CSI has ended in 2014 due to fast PV cost reduction starting from 2009, its experience has been transferred to other areas in the United States and in Europe. It is highly possible that other similar new technologies and products (e.g. the electric car and the battery) can adopt the CSI policy design, too. In summary, a good and successful policy may need to be simply, clear, credible, foreseeable, flexible, end-able, and incentive-compatible. The PV subsidy policy in China still has a long way to go when compared to the CSI.

Now we have a landmark agreement on climate change, the real work must begin.
The recent Paris climate change conference was a landmark success in global governance.
The final accord has won widespread acclaim from the world’s media and politicians. After a series of high-stakes and high-profile negotiations, the resultant Paris agreement has armed the international community’s commitment to limiting global temperature rise well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels.
Achieved amid a procession of international crises and tragedies — perhaps most notably the terrorist attacks in Paris — this agreement is justly celebrated as an occasion for renewed optimism, a genuine diplomatic achievement. The challenge now is to translate this moral victory into practical successes.
To translate the optimism into green and low-carbon development requires a lot of hard work — harder perhaps than many may realize. Each country arrived at the conference with its own pledges, the so-called intended national determined contributions. These national targets and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set the very foundation for the success of the Paris agreement. Now it is up to each country to deliver these goals.
Consider the world’s top two emitters, the United States and China. In the two years leading up to the Paris conference, progress made by the two countries on climate change has been real and unprecedented. Indeed, the agreements by the administrations of President Xi Jin-ping and President Barack Obama on this front generated major momentum for the Paris conference.
But looking forward, the road appears somewhat bumpy. Apart from the resistance of the US Congress, nearly half of the 50 states have made it clear that they will challenge Obama’s Clean Power Plan in court. This plan is considered the cornerstone of the US’ emissions pledges.
By the end of last year, US energy- related carbon emissions had declined by less than 10 percent in  the nine years since 2005, or about one percent per year on average. Using this as a proxy for overall greenhouse gas emissions trends, in the coming decade the rate of decarbonization in the economy will have to almost double in order to meet the US target in the Paris agreement.
Additionally, the joint presidential agreement signed by Xi and Obama to provide $3 billion (2.74 billion euros), or 3 percent of the $100 billion commitment made by developed countries, to the Green Climate Fund will have to be approved by Congress, where it has already been opposed by some key members. Thus, despite landing the Paris agreement, Obama will have to work even harder in his remaining year in office to secure a lasting legacy on climate change.

The Economic Consequence of Climate Change

China faces its own daunting challenges in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. China is expected to specifically outline how it will implement its INDCs in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). But reaching peak carbon emissions will require a lower rate of GDP growth, decreasing by roughly one-third over 15 years. Considering the current struggle to maintain economic growth in the new normal, both the economy and society will have to undergo tough transitions.
And herein lies catch-22. Under China’s INDCs, 20 percent of energy consumption will have to come from nonfossil fuels, which means 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of power generation capacity will need to be added over the next 15 years. This is equivalent to China installing the present-day US generation capacity, but based solely on nonfossil energy.
The required multitrillion-dollar investment would depend on rapid economic growth. In addition to the climate goals, the Chinese government is still working hard to eradicate poverty in the country, aiming to lift 70 million people out of poverty. Thus, a moderately high rate of economic growth is necessary, but this may be in conflict with the target for peak carbon emissions.

As a diplomatic agreement, the Paris agreement is commendable and historic. But now the task is to canalize this diplomatic goodwill and national ambition into practical achievements. Will the world be able to limit warming well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels? This will be a difficult —  some experts say outright impossible — task.
In the two years leading up to Paris, a popular term in the climate discourse was “post-Paris”. Now we are finally in post-Paris, and the real challenge has begun.

Esquire magazine collaborated with Brookings experts to present “fateful choices to make right now” in its December/January (2015/16) issue. Calling Brookings “a bullsh*t-free zone of critical inquiry, original research, and public-policy solutions for one hundred years,” Esquire notes that “our choices ought to bind us together rather than absolve us from responsibility for one another, because that’s what having a country—a commonwealth—means.” The issues are:

•	Climate change
•	Corporate tax rates and tax inversions
•	Transportation infrastructure
•	H-1B visas and skilled immigrant workers
•	Social mobility and “stuckness 
•	Marijuana legalization
•	The state of public defenders
•	Health care
•	Gun policy
•	Money in politics
•       American “greatness”

Highlights of the article and Brookings experts’ contributions to the ideas are presented below. You can download a PDF of the entire article here, or find it in magazines on newsstands. It will be available online in the new year.
(Esquire) “There’s not a ton the United States can do on its own about the Michael Bay movie that the earth is slowly becoming.”
Senior Fellow Adele Morris is an expert on the economics of climate change. She told Esquire that “If you’re not talking about putting fundamental changes into the market—if you’re not talking about pricing carbon—you’re not serious about climate change.”
In the leadup to the Paris climate conference, Morris and frequent collaborators Warwick McKibbin and Peter Wilcoxen (both nonresident senior fellows at Brookings) offer their carbon pricing plan (PDF) that “creates broad, efficient incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

“Because of these so called [tax] inversions—ten more of which are in progress, and all of which are stunning acts of national disloyalty—we lose not only jobs but also tax revenue.”
Senior Fellow Bill Gale has written that although the Obama administration issued new regulations in 2014 to limit the tax inversion practice, “Congress has not addressed the underlying tax causes of inversions, including high statutory U.S. corporate tax rates.” Gale moderated a panel of experts in an event on corporate tax inversions that featured remarks from Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). As we learn of Pfizer Inc.’s plan to buy Ireland-based Allergan in an inversion deal, which will also create the world’s largest drugmaker, the issue maintains its resonance.

“147,870 bridges … have been deemed structurally deficient or obsolete, as well as … 570,673 miles of public road in the United States … are now in poor condition.”
“We’re not even maintaining our basic transportation infrastructure,” Senior Fellow Rob Puentes, director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at Brookings, told Esquire. “We look with envy at Europe and Japan and their high-speed rail and great leaps forward in 21st-century ideas, and wonder why we can’t be more like them.” These countries are, Puentes says, “just doing there what we used to do here.”
In a recent paper, he and co-author William Galston, also a senior fellow, explain four positive outcomes of closing “the infrastructure investment gap”: 1) boost jobs; 2) enhance economic growth by decreasing business overhead; 3) better connect households to jobs, health care, and education; and 4) reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“Should we limit the number of smart people living in the U.S.?”
The H-1B visa allows highly-skilled foreign workers to take positions in specialty occupations, such as engineering and computer programming, in the U.S. Esquire observes that in 2015, 148,000 highly-skilled workers applied for the visa but did not get one of the limited number of available visas. Brookings experts have studied the H-1B visa system and recommended reforms including making the system less complex, finding ways to retain STEM foreign students, and paying attention to the geographic distribution of H-1B demand to better allocate visas.

“At the very heart of the American idea is the notion that, unlike in other places, we can start from nothing and through hard work have everything. … But what if that’s just a myth?”

Senior Fellow Richard Reeves writes, in a full essay in this edition of Esquire, that “America is stuck.” The problem isn’t the American Dream, he argues, but “the growing failure to realize it. Two necessary ingredients of Americanism—meritocracy and momentum—are now sorely lacking.” And the result is what Reeves describes as stuckness, a feeling of “limited possibilities and uncertain futures,” and “weak circulation and mobility across class lines.” Reeves offers many data points to back up the argument, including:

•	7.5 percent of American children born into the bottom rung of the ladder rise to the top, compared to 13.5 in Canada
•	Those born at or near the top of the economic ladder stand a 56 percent chance of staying there as adults

Reeves further explores the social mobility problem as it disproportionately affects black Americans. The average white household has 13 times the wealth of the average black one, and 66 percent of black children live in America’s poorest neighborhoods, compared to 6 percent of white children. In the Esquire article and also on the Social Mobility Memos blog at Brookings, Reeves offers ideas for rectifying the problem. “The future success of the American idea must now be intentional,” he says.
Watch this video for Reeves explanation of the social mobility problem:


“For the purposes of federal regulation, law enforcement, and all-around sanity, all Americans deserve some clarity on the legality of marijuana …”
Fellow John Hudak’s research on marijuana policy shows that over 149 million Americans live in states with full medical marijuana programs, and over 17 million live in states with legal recreational marijuana. As he tells Esquire, “the conversation around legalization almost always begins with a false premise: if we legalize, all of the sudden we’ll start having drugs everywhere, as if these drugs and the economies around them don’t already exist.” The alternative is to tax and regulate marijuana to create effective and efficient markets that lead to what Hudak calls “an aboveground, white-market economic impact.” 
One particular aspect of the marijuana debate that has been on Hudak’s radar is the conflicting regulatory regime around medical (i.e., not recreational) marijuana. “Of all the controlled substances that the federal government regulates, cannabis is treated in unique ways that impede research.” Watch the video about this below:


“Anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of criminal defendants rely on public defenders. The only hitch is that there aren’t enough of them.”
Esquire notes that all Americans “have a constitutional right to attorney” but that it would take up to 6,900 additional public defenders just “to handle the current caseload.” This gap can “undermine everything from policing to prisons” and higher-quality representation in the judicial system “would result in a justice system actually worthy of the name.”

“With each and every one of the Republican candidates for president vowing to repeal and replace Obamacare … and with Republicans all but certain to maintain control of [Congress through 2018], there’s a good chance that this dog might actually catch the car.”
Eighteen million people currently have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges or through expanded Medicaid programs run by states. Brookings health policy experts, including Senior Fellow Alice Rivlin (who directs the health policy center at Brookings) and Senior Fellow Henry Aaron in particular have offered analysis and ideas on health costs, coverage, and the ACA.
Rivlin argued, in a recent paper on economic issues the presidential candidates should address, that “the GOP must have a detailed plan to ‘replace’ the ACA if they repeal it” while “Democrats should go beyond ACA defense and a technical corrections bill” to focus on specific policy modifications. Aaron has recently looked at what United Health Care’s announcement that it might stop selling health insurance through ACA exchanges in 2017 might mean.
Get more research and commentary on health policy issues from the Center for Health Policy at Brookings.

“So if you buy a gun off the Internet, should you have a NICS check done just as if you were buying a gun from a licensed dealer?”
Esquire observes that “an interesting thing has been happening at the grassroots level—an earnest effort by gun owners to close the personal-sales loophole” that permits this type of gun sale to bypass the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Gun control—or gun safety—policy isn’t a policy focus for Brookings scholars, but in 2013, a Brookings Essay treated the issue following the massacre of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In that essay, Matt Bennett, senior VP for public affairs at Third Way, wrote of the attempt in the shooting’s aftermath to close the gun show loophole. 
That same year, John Hudak also wrote of efforts in Connecticut to make gun control work. “As the first anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School nears,” Hudak wrote in late 2013, “officials across Connecticut are working together, in a bipartisan manner, to meet citizen demands to address gun violence, lapses in the mental health care system, and weaknesses in school safety.”

“When money has been legally found to equal speech, how much speech can you afford? Even if it’s to support a cause or candidate you find worthy, should anyone have that kind of power?”
John Richardson, a contributor to Esquire, writes in a short essay in the Brookings-Esquire spread that the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United allows “unlimited sums of money … [to] concentrate power in a way the robber barons could have only dreamed.” 
VP and Director of Governance Studies Darrell West explored the phenomenon of the super-wealthy in politics in his 2014 book “Billionaires.” In the book, West examined how the top one percent own about a third of the assets in America and around 40 percent of assets worldwide, giving them extraordinary influence on elections, public policy, and governance.

Kazakhstan also makes money from Chinese goods carried across its territory to Europe.But Sino-Kazakh ties have been strained by Beijing’s de-radicalisation campaign in its western Xinjiang province, where the United Nations estimates over a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps.China has denied the camps violate the rights of ethnic minorities and says they were designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills.The Chinese policies have affected ethnic Kazakhs living in Xinjiang, but the Kazakh government has not criticised the campaign and has chosen instead to seek the release of those who had Kazakh citizenship or were seeking it.Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Additional reporting by Judy Hua and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Editing by David HolmesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Chairwoman Gayle Manchin, Vice Chair Tony Perkins, and Vice Chair Anurima Bhargava, thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning. The rise in digital authoritarianism and corresponding decline in human rights, including the right to worship freely, are two of the most pressing issues the world faces today. Nowhere do those issues enjoy greater urgency than in modern China, where the Xi regime and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have relied on digital technologies to carry out human rights abuses and curtail religious freedom with unprecedented efficiency and scale.

Digital Authoritarianism & the CCP
Before turning to the Xi regime and religion, I should first lay out what I mean by digital authoritarianism more broadly. As with all political regimes, authoritarian leaders are obsessed with their survival. Yet staying in power is not easy: regimes need to closely monitor not only elite opinion and public opinion, but also potential dissidents and opposition groups. Digital technology offers a new way to solve that challenge. As the cost of storing, collecting, and analyzing data has plummeted, the capabilities of digital surveillance systems have grown exponentially. Regimes with sufficient technical expertise can now monitor both aggregate opinion and specific individuals with greater precision and detail than ever before. Digital authoritarianism refers to the use of such technologies to consolidate regime power and better ensure regime survival.
No authoritarian state has leveraged digital technologies more successfully than modern China. Dating back to the early 1980s, the CCP has consistently taken a two-pronged approach to information technology. On the one hand, they have aggressively cultivated and fostered a domestic technology industry in the pursuit of economic growth. On the other, the CCP has erected an elaborate infrastructure for monitoring and surveilling the domestic use of digital platforms. Forty years later, the strategy has proven a resounding success. China is now a world leader not just in the manufacture of commodity hardware and electronics, but of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence. At the same time, domestic programs like the Great Firewall and Sharp Eyes have given the CCP censorship and surveillance capabilities far in excess of what they enjoyed previously. Rather than leading to greater political openness and instability, the CCP’s push into information technology has provided the party with powerful and unprecedented new tools for surveilling the speech and behavior of its citizens.
For religious groups targeted by the CCP, the result has been as devastating as it is tragic.
Digital Authoritarianism and the CCP’s Repression of Religion
After the religious purges of the Mao era, the CCP Central Committee famously loosened restrictions on religious practice in the early 1980s with the issuance of Document 19. Yet the CCP nonetheless continued to view many religious communities as a threat, particularly those it believes to have ties with co-religionists abroad. In the time since, the party has typically dealt with that threat through a twofold strategy of Sinicization and repression.
Digital technologies have rendered that repression far more effective. As with authoritarians elsewhere, the CCP has long been able to repress public forms of religious organizations, practices, identities, and beliefs, particularly in urban areas. But private forms of religiosity, including those practiced within one’s home, have proven more difficult to monitor and repress. Digital technologies have changed that. As processors, sensors, and cameras have proliferated, the extent of religious life that the CCP can surveil has expanded dramatically.
Consider the following:
Religious organizations. Video and audio surveillance of public mosques, churches, and temples has exploded. Rather than simply shut down a religious school or house of worship, authorities can monitor all activity and individuals within those facilities and sanction undesired behavior or individuals with greater specificity. Video surveillance has become so important to Chinese authorities that they recently shut down a popular church in Beijing after it refused to install internal CCTV cameras.
Yet digital technology has also enabled greater surveillance of underground religious organizations and networks. From video feeds to GPS tracking, authorities have greater ability to detect religious groups that meet and operate covertly. In Xinjiang, for instance, smartphone location data, vehicle location data, checkpoint logs, facial recognition technology, and video feeds from buses, streets, and drones, can be used to identify when individuals in the same religious network meet together covertly, potentially even in real-time.
Religious identities. From headwear to jewelry, many religions have customary vestments and adornments that signify religious identity. Surveillance states have long used such markers to track and surveil religious minorities, but digital technologies make such surveillance possible on a larger scale. By feeding machine learning algorithms large numbers of images of religious minorities, Chinese companies such as CloudWalk have developed software that estimates whether a given frame of video contains the image of a religious minority. Although the accuracy of these algorithms is likely poor, they are nonetheless being used for real-time classification by police and security services around China, with authorities being notified when someone who is classified as a Uighur Muslim or Tibetan Buddhist appears on a CCTV feed. Surveillance software that scans for religious identity is particularly problematic in light of legal codes like Xinjiang’s recent regulation on extremism, which prohibits clothing and symbols associated with “extremist” religious beliefs and movements.
Religious practices. Historically, religious practices have been difficult to monitor without excessive amounts of manpower, particularly outside of urban areas. Yet as with religious identity, networked video feeds have made it possible to observe religious practices in a far wider range of contexts. For instance, the Sharp Eyes project enables authorized individuals within a community to view feeds not only from public security cameras, but also from smartphones and smart TVs, including those within private residences and homes. Since China’s recent counterterrorism law and Xinjiang’s “de-extremification regulations” refer only vaguely to religious behaviors that may lead to terrorism and extremism, such systems would make it possible for authorities to detain individuals for privately observing customary religious practices. (In Xinjiang, individuals have been detained merely for possessing recordings of the Quran.)
Religious belief. Compared with monitoring religious identity and practices, monitoring religious beliefs has always been more difficult, because it requires access to an individual’s private writing and speech. Yet digital technologies have also made it easier to monitor the religious beliefs an individual expresses and engages with. The smartphone in particular has revolutionized state surveillance of religious belief. Not only are Chinese authorities able to monitor messages on WeChat and other applications, but they can also require individuals to install logging software that tracks all video, audio, and text stored on the phone or accessed online. Chinese officials have already used these techniques to detain individuals merely for texting verses of the Quran.
What makes these new forms of religious surveillance so alarming is that they are being coupled with longstanding forms of mass repression.
To date the most extensive campaigns of repression have come in Tibet and western China. In the former, Chen Quanguo, the Party Secretary for the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), implemented the “iron grid” campaign in 2011. Borrowing from the “grid strategy” that was first deployed in Beijing in the lead-up to 2008 Olympics, Chen’s program divided Tibetan cities and towns into cells, each of which had a police unit with access to video and communications feeds within the cell. In addition, all Tibetans were required to register with Internet Service Providers under their real identity. Coupled with a dramatic increase in Tibetan police units and an expansion of party offices throughout the region, the surveillance decreased the reported number of immolations and protests within the TAR, but at a significant cost to the freedom and vitality of the Tibetan Buddhist community.
Yet Tibet was just a trial run for what was to come in Xinjiang. In 2016, Chen Quanguo was appointed party secretary of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). By that time, smartphones and drones had become far more capable than in 2011, and breakthroughs in deep learning had made real-time object detection and facial recognition more feasible.  Replicating what he had done in Tibet, Chen quickly established a grid system as part of the broader counter-extremism effort known as the “Strike Hard Campaign.” Chen and authorities within the XUAR relied heavily on information technology to tie their surveillance system together. To monitor the movement of Xinjiang’s Muslim population, buses were required to have video cameras, vehicles were required to install Beidou satellite navigation systems, personal smartphones were installed with tracking software, and frequent checkpoints were erected at which DNA samples were taken. To help analyze and monitor the information that was collected, Chen commissioned the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) in 2017. The IJOP is now functional and has played an integral role in tracking the movements, activity, and communications of religious minorities in the region. In particular, the IJOP and other surveillance systems have enabled state authorities to monitor and enforce recent counter-terrorism and counter-extremism laws and regulations. Since the regulations are often deliberately vague about which religious behaviors and practices qualify as “extremist,” authorities are often able to find data points within the information they’ve collected to justify internment. As a result of these and related efforts, an estimated 10% of Uighur Muslims have passed through the region’s detention camps. There they have been subject not only to forced labor, but also rape, forced sterilization and abortion, and even mental incapacitation.
Although Tibet and the XUAR are the most extreme examples, religious minorities in those regions are not the only groups that the CCP has targeted. The party has also relied on digital surveillance to target Christians, as well as spiritual movements like the Falun Gong. As the legal scholar Eva Pils has noted, “What happens in Xinjiang and what happens to house churches is connected … Those kinds of new attitudes have translated into different types of measures against Christians, which amount to intensified persecution of religious groups.”
U.S. Policy Response
As digital surveillance technologies mature, the appeal of digital authoritarianism is only set to grow. The United States should seek to counter the CCP’s digital repression of religion in Tibet and Xinjiang not only to help protect the communities suffering human rights abuses there, but also to deter future campaigns within China and around the world.
Recently the White House signed into law the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, co-signed a letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council calling on the CCP to end the detention programs in Xinjiang, and sanctioned Chen Quanguo and other government officials and technology executives responsible for mass repression campaigns.
All of those measures are welcome, but they will not be enough. The United States should also consider the following policies:
Pressure Muslim allies. If the world has remained silent on Xinjiang, that is at least partly because Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, and other major Muslim countries have yet to speak out vocally, forcefully, and consistently about the plight of Muslims there. In fact, not only have they not condemned the measures China has taken, but in response to the recent UNHCR letter signed by the United States and other democracies, Saudi Arabia and many Muslim majority countries signed a separate letter condoning China’s detention policies. The United States should continue to pressure Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries to reverse course and more aggressively speak out.
International independent monitors. The CCP has acknowledged the existence of camps in Xinjiang, but insists that they are used solely for educational purposes. The international community should pressure the CCP into allowing international independent monitors into the region to investigate the camps directly. Since there is evidence that the CCP has begun to transfer some detainees to prisons in response to the concerns raised about the camps, the monitors should be able to visit prisons as well.
Impose targeted export controls. Although China is essential to the global manufacturing supply chain for both processors and sensors, it has struggled to become a world leader in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. In particular, the Chinese technology sector has yet to demonstrate it can design and produce the photolithography machines with which state-of-the-art chips are fabricated. The United States should work with the Netherlands and Japan, the two other democratic countries which produce photolithography machines, in blocking the continued sale of such equipment to China.
Develop international standards. For the United States and other democracies to effectively counter digital authoritarianism, critiquing the irresponsible and unethical use of artificial intelligence by the CCP and other authoritarian regimes won’t be sufficient. The United States and its democratic allies must also develop, articulate, and adhere to alternative standards and models for the responsible use of AI and emerging technologies. Further, the United States and its allies must rigorously uphold those standards in their own counter-terrorism and counter-extremism efforts.
2022 Beijing Olympics. As with other authoritarian regimes, the CCP views the Olympics as an opportunity to establish its power and legitimacy on a world stage. So long as the CCP continues to operate mass detention camps and carry out related human rights violations, the United States and other democracies should consider conditioning its participation in the upcoming 2022 Beijing Olympics on the cessation of mass repression in Xinjiang and elsewhere.
The United States can and must push back against the technological surveillance of religion by the CCP, and digital authoritarianism more broadly. As the capabilities of digital surveillance technologies grow, authoritarian regimes will look to the programs the CCP has implemented in Tibet and Xinjiang as a potential model for how to surveil and control religious minorities. We owe it to the victims of religious repression in those regions to ensure that their experiences remain an exception rather than a normalized form of social and political control.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
States have long interfered in the domestic politics of other states. Foreign election interference is nothing new, nor are misinformation campaigns. The new feature of the 2016 election was the role of technology in personalizing and then amplifying the information to maximize the impact. As a 2019 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded, malicious actors will continue to weaponize information and develop increasingly sophisticated tools for personalizing, targeting, and scaling up the content.

This report focuses on those tools. It outlines the logic of digital personalization, which uses big data to analyze individual interests to determine the types of messages most likely to resonate with particular demographics. The report speaks to the role of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks in creating tools that distinguish quickly between objects, for example a stop sign versus a kite, or in a battlefield context, a combatant versus a civilian. Those same technologies can also operate in the service of misinformation through text prediction tools that receive user inputs and produce new text that is as credible as the original text itself. The report addresses potential policy solutions that can counter digital personalization, closing with a discussion of regulatory or normative tools that are less likely to be effective in countering the adverse effects of digital technology.

Executive summary
China’s rapid technological advances are playing a leading role in contemporary geopolitical competition. The United States, and many of its partners and allies, have a range of concerns about how Beijing may deploy or exploit technology in ways that challenge many of their core interests and values. While the U.S. has maintained its position as the technologically dominant power for decades, China has made enormous investments and implemented policies that have contributed significantly to its economic growth, military capability, and global influence. In some areas, China has eclipsed, or is on the verge of eclipsing, the United States — particularly in the rapid deployment of certain technologies.

These dynamics are enmeshed in a broader context of U.S.-China tensions; U.S. alliance management challenges; complex and shifting global supply chains; debates over economic and technology “decoupling”; tensions between norms of research openness and concerns about technology transfer; a contest for global technology standard-setting; rapid technological development in other countries, particularly in East Asia; and transnational debate about the regulation of large technology firms.
There is also an important debate about the relationship between China’s record of achievement in meeting its ambitions and what that record says about the long-term prospects for its development of key technologies. While some analysts focus on the persistent gap between the rhetoric of Beijing’s five-year plans versus its actual achievements, others point to an overarching record of extraordinary progress. The Chinese Communist Party’s ambition to “catch up with and surpass” the West in advanced technologies is hardly new. It traces a lineage in Party guidance from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping, with an emphasis on technology as a source of national power and key domain of international competition, and “indigenization” as a top priority. But as China’s economic and political influence have expanded, so, too, have many of its technological ambitions and achievements.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic shock in its wake are also likely to impact, if not profoundly shape, many of these dynamics in foreseeable and unforeseeable ways.
This installment of papers for the Brookings Foreign Policy project “Global China: Assessing China’s Growing Role in the World” assesses China’s growing technological reach in the world by focusing on both thematic and technology-specific topics. Thematically, the papers explore the broad dynamics of U.S.-China technology competition, the relationship between the regulation of large U.S. technology firms and strategic competition with China, technology transfer and alliance management, and China’s role in the global competition for technology talent. On specific technologies, our contributors assess China’s progress in the development of fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology, weapons enabled by autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI), power grid cybersecurity, financial technology, biotechnology, surveillance technologies, semiconductors, and space technology. They examine China’s ambitions, obstacles, and achievements, and recommend policy options for the United States and its partners and allies.

Michael Brown, Eric Chewning, and Pavneet Singh argue that the United States is in a “superpower marathon” with China, an economic and technology race in which the U.S. must compete with — rather than contain — China. Brown, Chewning, and Singh emphasize the degree to which technology and innovation will drive U.S.-China economic competition and the U.S. role in the world. They advocate a strategy designed to improve U.S. competitiveness and focus on long-term capability development. In particular, they propose larger  investments in  research and development (R&D) including a focus on engineering talent, an integrated U.S. economic strategy across government, and longer-term focus for U.S. businesses and capital markets.
Tom Wheeler argues that, if the United States is to “outinnovate” China, it must embrace competition-driven innovation and “reorient our industrial age thinking to embrace policies that take advantage of the nonrivalrous nature of data.” For years, some of America’s largest technology companies have argued that the best strategy to manage the technology challenges posed by China is to allow them to “expand their already dominant marketplace positions, and to resist regulation.” Wheeler makes the case that entrepreneurs must be able to access “digital assets that have been locked away by the dominant companies,” in a manner that protects privacy. He urges legislators and regulators to more vigorously protect consumers and competition, and to define the challenges posed by AI less in terms of “implementation,” where China has an advantage, but instead through the lens of innovation, where he argues the U.S. retains the advantage. He advocates an approach that does not mimic Beijing’s embrace of national champions and avoids “the ‘China doesn’t regulate their companies that way’ smokescreen,” but instead embraces “the all-American concept of competition-driving innovation.”
Elsa B. Kania focuses on Chinese advancements in “intelligent” and autonomous weapons systems. The Chinese military and defense industry have undertaken major initiatives in research, development, and experimentation in autonomy and AI-enabled weapons systems that could threaten global security and stability, particularly as U.S.-China rivalry intensifies. China continues to sell weapons systems to U.S. adversaries and militaries with poor human rights records, undermining U.S. values and risking the further diffusion of these weapons systems to malicious non-state actors. However, China’s progress will be contingent on its ability to overcome significant hurdles to testing, training, and application in realworld scenarios. As China seeks to leverage innovation in the science and technology fields in pursuit of great power status, it will also face building pressure to more seriously address emergent safety, technical, legal, and ethical considerations. Kania argues that the United States must closely monitor Chinese military and technological advancements in this area, exercise caution when disclosing new U.S. capabilities, and engage in dialogue with allies and partners as well as Chinese military counterparts to reduce the risk of unintended escalation.
Nicol Turner Lee notes the stakes of an intensifying competition between the United States and China to deploy 5G wireless networks. She argues that, in this competition, the United States and China have taken very different approaches in developing these networks. In particular, she surfaces the risks of a “split digital ecosystem worldwide” spurred by China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and the potential for China to “lock in” other nations with its 5G technology. In the United States, bureaucratic delays restrict access to 5G spectrum and rising national security concerns surrounding Huawei, China’s dominant 5G player, are impacting the global supply chain. In particular, she identifies tensions between U.S. diplomacy on Huawei, legacy network interdependence, and cost structures. Despite China’s slight lead in the areas of spectrum and equipment, however, Turner Lee notes that the U.S. historically has maintained dominance over innovation and could make up for lost time with a more coordinated 5G strategy. She recommends that the United States pursue more flexible and timely spectrum policies, scalable alternatives for 5G equipment, and a long-term plan — including of increased R&D spending — to develop future platforms enabled by advanced mobile networks.
Aaron Klein documents that, “whereas America led the global revolution in payments half a century ago with magnetic striped credit and debit cards, China is leading the new revolution in digital payments,” moving to a system based on smartphones and QR codes (two-dimensional bar codes), in which traditional banks play a diminished role. WeChat Pay and Alipay, based on social media and digital commerce platforms respectively, are China’s primary digital payment systems. The powerful reach of these platforms — combining information on social connectivity and financial flows between and among individuals and firms — opens up a new range of possibilities, and major concerns regarding privacy. Klein also notes the potential for anti-competitive behavior. He suggests that digital payments are unlikely to catch on in the United States and other countries where “the payment system is skewed to providing substantial rewards to wealthier consumers, through tax-free rebates on highend credit cards,” but may be more viable in other countries with less-developed banking systems. Klein notes that countries that receive large numbers of Chinese tourists face pressure to offer Chinese digital payment options, and that “the overall outcome seems clear: Chinese payment systems will increasingly be integrated into global payments.”
Sheena Chestnut Greitens focuses on the growing adoption of China’s public security and surveillance technology platforms around the world. Huawei boasts in its 2018 annual report that its “Safe City” projects are “in 700 cities across more than 100 countries and regions.” Greitens finds that there is relatively little correlation between such platform adoption and the levels of democracy or freedom in adopting countries, and that both “push” and “pull” factors appear to be driving the adoption of this technology. Major questions remain about the implications and advantages that China could derive from its activities in this sector, and Greitens argues U.S. policymakers will need a nuanced approach to the tradeoffs that leaders in adopting countries confront. While there are concerns about how these technologies could contribute to the entrenchment of authoritarian rule in some countries, or the weakening of democratic norms in others, many leaders in adopting countries also see potential for these platforms to solve urgent public problems, such as violent crime. Greitens also argues that U.S. policymakers must address Chinese technology companies’ often quiet initiatives to shape the global regulatory environment. She recommends that the United States urgently propose a set of standards that are compatible with U.S. values — respect for human rights, civil liberties, privacy, and democracy.
Remco Zwetsloot explores China’s approach to global technology talent competition. He describes China’s strategy to grow its science and technology talent as: 1) improving domestic education; 2) attracting overseas Chinese talent; and 3) attracting foreign talent. While China’s commitment to domestic education reform has achieved remarkable results — science and engineering degrees granted by Chinese universities more than quadrupled from 360,000 in 2000 to 1.7 million in 2015 — there remain significant challenges associated with instructional quality and employment opportunities for many graduates. Attracting and retaining talent from abroad has proven particularly challenging. Zwetsloot also highlights the dilemmas faced by other countries in responding to China’s talent ambitions. China is the world’s biggest source of foreign-born talent, and countries often compete to attract Chinese talent to their universities and firms. But, as China has focused on attracting returnees, there have been growing concerns about the implications for competitiveness and national security. Zwetsloot warns of three potential pitfalls for U.S. policymakers responding to China’s technology talent initiatives. First, the United States’ ability to retain Chinese talent is a challenge to China’s technological ambitions, so the U.S. should avoid restrictions that undermine this advantage. Second, unilateral U.S. actions designed to minimize technology transfer could simply channel Chinese talent to other countries; the U.S. should therefore coordinate technology transfer and related policies with its allies and partners. Third, the U.S. must not only adopt defensive measures, but also affirmative domestic education and immigration reform. Chinese strategists, Zwetsloot notes, explicitly cite restrictive U.S. immigration policies as “opportunities to bolster” China’s AI talent, and meaningful U.S. immigration reform as posing “a huge challenge” for China’s talent ambitions.
Andrew Imbrie and Ryan Fedasiuk assert that the United States and its allies must develop targeted and coordinated policies to respond to unwanted Chinese technology transfer, as part of a broader agenda of technology alliance cooperation. Analyzing scholarship programs, technology entrepreneurship competitions, and foreign direct investment as vehicles for technology transfer, Imbrie and Fedasiuk recommend that the U.S. and its allies should assess “the potential risks to [their] economic security, the resilience of American and allied companies to withstand potential reprisal and loss of market share, and the rules of the road that will protect liberal democratic values and strengthen long-term economic competitiveness.” Imbrie and Fedasiuk recommend that the U.S. and its allies gather more data, raise greater awareness of the variety of vehicles China uses for technology transfer, and coordinate investment screening procedures.
Scott Moore explores China’s trajectory in the global biotechnology sector. While the United States has been the dominant global player in developing and commercializing biotechnology for decades, China is determined to become a leading player in biotechnology and is investing heavily in the sector. Moore argues that, while the U.S. is likely to remain ahead in most biotechnology fields,  China’s biotechnology sector can  still  be expected to produce significant innovations in coming years, and the Chinese market will increasingly inform global biotechnology research, development, and commercialization. China is therefore poised to become a critical player in policy and governance issues related to biotechnology, even as it works to overcome deficiencies in research and development and higher-risk financing. Several national security concerns attach to the maturation of China’s biotechnology sector, including military uses of human performance enhancement and synthetic bioweapons production, the collection and use of biomedical data on American citizens for espionage or other nefarious purposes, and access to and control over biomedical data, which could fuel AI for biomedical applications, and shape the economic competitiveness of the U.S. biotechnology sector. However, Moore also suggests avenues for cooperation, including in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shared interests in biosafety and biosecurity protocols also could open channels of cooperation in the way that shared concerns about nuclear security and nonproliferation did in previous decades.
Frank A. Rose outlines how China has rapidly expanded its presence in outer space in both the civil and military arenas. China’s People’s Liberation Army has conducted a major reorganization to better integrate space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare systems with its other military capabilities. Rose argues that, in light of these developments, the United States will need to develop a strategy that deters China’s advancing anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities, while also addressing sustainability and safety concerns like orbital debris, space traffic management, and the rise of mega-satellite constellations. The United States will also need find a modus operandi for engaging with China on civil space projects while safeguarding national security interests. Rose outlines several recommendations, including a dialogue on civil space and space security issues, enhancing deterrence against Chinese ASAT threats, and efforts to agree on norms of behavior for outer space.
Tom Stefanick argues that the United States’ and China’s mutual concern about the security of their increasingly complex electrical grids could provide an opening for mutual restraint on activities perceived as threatening each other’s grid networks. Stefanick highlights the strategic significance of these networks, and the accompanying gravity of cybersecurity risks, particularly as the United States and China take steps to connect their grids to the internet. China is now the world’s largest electricity producer by far, producing at least 70% more electric energy in 2019 than the United States. While China has been developing and fielding an array of technology management approaches to grid security, Stefanick focuses on the application of AI and, in the future, the potential for quantum applications as well. He distinguishes China’s and Russia’s approaches to grid security, highlighting Russia’s cyberattacks on Ukraine’s power grids.
Saif M. Khan and Carrick Flynn address China’s ambitions, achievements, and obstacles in developing an indigenous semiconductor industry, and argue that it is in the strategic interest of the United States and democratic allies and partners for China to remain reliant on them for state-of-the-art computer chips. China is investing heavily to produce advanced chips that can power weapons systems that could threaten the U.S. and its allies and partners, as well as technoauthoritarian surveillance that violates human rights. Khan and Flynn recommend coordinated, multilateral export controls (with Japan and the Netherlands in particular) on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to slow, if not halt, China’s progress toward producing advanced chips, and thereby inhibit China’s development and use of dangerous or otherwise concerning technologies. Because the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea are currently the only economies with significant, near-state-of-the-art chip fabrication factory capacity, and because global chip demand is arguably independent of where chips are produced, Khan and Flynn argue that the export controls they prescribe would, over the long-term, shift a significant portion of China’s lost chip fabrication capacity to democracies.
Together, these assessments illustrate that technological developments both reflect and inform strategic competition between the United States and China, and broader alliance management challenges that the U.S. must address to maintain a favorable balance of power vis-à-vis a rising China. They document China’s extraordinary investment and progress in many technological domains, as well as persistent obstacles to achieving sometimes longstanding ambitions. They reveal critical linkages between foreign and domestic policy through the strategic and cross-border reach of domestic technology policy and regulation, as well as the domestic impacts of global standard-setting initiatives. Finally, the contributors to this series have assembled an impressive and ambitious agenda for U.S. and allied competitiveness that merits close attention from policymakers in the United States and around the world.

The technology debacle at the Iowa Caucus reinforces a national cynicism that nothing seems to work. The Trump campaign was quick to jump on the mishap, appealing to such cynicism by asking how the Democrats can be trusted to run the country if they can’t count noses in a school gymnasium. Iowa was a digital age mishap, but the effects of the collision of digital technology and democracy extend beyond the Hawkeye state.

Problems in reporting the vote sow seeds of doubt about the functioning of democracy itself. Those seeds fall in fields already plowed by technological tumult. The digital era was supposed to open a new Golden Age—for Americans and for democracy. Instead, it has delivered job losses, privacy invasions, and a longing for the good old days.
Beyond a bad app in Iowa, digital technology is gnawing at the core of democracy by dividing us into tribes and devaluing truth.
Social media undermines what the Founding Fathers were focusing on when they wrote “We the People” and established the motto “E Pluribus Unum” (out of many, one). The concept of “We” and the formation of a “Unum” is essential for democracy to work. Humans are inherently tribal. Democracy requires us to overcome that tribalism—to find our Unum—in the pursuit of a greater good. In contrast, the business plans of the dominant digital companies are built on dividing us into tribes in order to sell targeted access to each tribe.
What’s more, the digital companies operate in secret. It is in secret, inside the black box algorithms, that Americans are sorted into tribes. After the sorting, the software algorithms then secretly determine what message is to be delivered to each group.

5 steps to get the internet to all Americans

Tom Wheeler
Wednesday, May 27, 2020






The internet was supposed to be the great gift to democracy because everyone would be free to express themselves without the interference of editors or other filters. Instead, the business model of the internet—collecting and manipulating personal information to sell targeting services—has created the tool for attacking the democratic imperative to seek Unum. Our foreign adversaries have proven especially talented in exploiting this capability. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that, after exploiting social media in the 2016 campaign, foreign disinformation campaigns have “never stopped.”
Not only does the business plan of the internet enable such attacks, but also the lack of curation allows lies to run rampant. In 1996 Congress exempted digital services from liability for what they distribute. It was a time when the internet was defined by screeching modems, services such as AOL and CompuServe, and a technology full of promise. A quarter of a century later that exemption—known as Section 230—has become the pathway for liars, both foreign and domestic. Instead of protecting the open flow of a rich debate, this law has protected the secret sorting and delivery of untruths and half-truths without accountability.
Every new communications technology has produced new challenges; we should not expect to be exempt from the need to deal with those challenges. Back in the 1920s and 30s the new technology of broadcasting brought concerns that it could be captured by anti-democratic forces. Congress acted to assure that conflicting ideas had access to the airwaves. After seeing how Hitler manipulated the German public using the media, and with the rising fear of Communism, in 1949 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) imposed a Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters to require the airing of all sides of a controversial issue.

The Fairness Doctrine was repealed by the Reagan FCC in 1987. The result was conservative talk radio. That Rush Limbaugh could stand and receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the State of the Union is testimony to the effect of eliminating the requirement for radio stations to present all sides of an issue.
But you can turn the dial if you don’t want to listen to Rush. There is less choice with social media. What economists call “network effects” mean everyone wants to be on the social media platform everyone else is on. The result is a captive audience to be secretly sorted and served by software.
What should replace Section 230? Our democracy, after all is built on strong First Amendment protections. However, laws require advertisers to be truthful in their claims, and for broadcasters to follow behavioral standards. Newspapers can be held liable for what they publish—but what about the newspaper’s digital equivalent? Because a digital company distributes information on the internet, Section 230 sets it free of basic responsibilities.
Truth cannot be allowed to become a casualty of technology. The search for democratic Unum cannot be allowed to become a casualty of technology. It is no wonder cynicism abounds when untruth and tribalism are the result of our principal communications tool. Historically, society has stepped up to the challenges of new technology. Now is our historic moment.

In Beyond Disruption: Technology’s Challenge to Governance, George P. Shultz, Jim Hoagland, and James Timbie present views from some of the country’s top experts in the sciences, humanities, and military that scrutinize the rise of post-millennium technologies in today’s global society. They contemplate both the benefits and peril carried by the unprecedented speed of these innovations—from genetic editing, which enables us new ways to control infectious diseases, to social media, whose ubiquitous global connections threaten the function of democracies across the world.
Decision makers are watching as a surge of new technologies begin to take hold of nearly every industry. Beyond Disruption’s contributors explore this rapid wave of technological advancement and assess its impact on society and national security. Some techniques, like the advent of machine learning, have enabled engineers to create systems that will make us more productive. For example, self-driving vehicles promise to make trucking safer, faster, and cheaper. However, using big data and artificial intelligence to automate complex tasks also ends up threatening to disrupt both routine professions like taxi driving and cognitive work by accountants, radiologists, lawyers, and even computer programmers themselves.
Brookings Institution Nonresident Senior Fellow William Drozdiak authored chapter 7: “Governance from an International Perspective.” This chapter examines how technological advancements are a double-edged sword: they offer a great leap forward for humanity – instant communications around the globe or the creation of driverless cars that curtail deadly accidents – providing democracies with tools to empower the voices of common people; but they can also be viewed as potential threats to political order, shared prosperity, and stable communities.

I’ll bet you’ve read something about technology and learning recently. You may have read that device use enhances learning outcomes. Or perhaps you’ve read that screen time is not good for kids. Maybe you’ve read that there’s no link between adolescents’ screen time and their well-being. Or that college students’ learning declines the more devices are present in their classrooms.

If ever there were a case to be made that more research can cloud rather than clarify an issue, technology use and learning seems to fit the bill. This piece covers what the research actually says, some outstanding questions, and how to approach the use of technology in learning environments to maximize opportunities for learning and minimize the risk of doing harm to students.
The good
In my recent posts, I have frequently cited the mixed evidence about blended learning, which strategically integrates in-person learning with technology to enable real-time data use, personalized instruction, and mastery-based progression. One thing that this nascent evidence base does show is that technology can be linked to improved learning. When technology is integrated into lessons in ways that are aligned with good in-person teaching pedagogy, learning can be better than without technology.
A 2018 meta-analysis of dozens of rigorous studies of ed tech, along with the executive summary of a forthcoming update (126 rigorous experiments), indicated that when education technology is used to individualize students’ pace of learning, the results overall show “enormous promise.” In other words, ed tech can improve learning when used to personalize instruction to each student’s pace.
Further, this same meta-analysis, along with other large but correlational studies (e.g., OECD 2015), also found that increased access to technology in school was associated with improved proficiency with, and increased use of, technology overall. This is important in light of the fact that access to technology outside of learning environments is still very unevenly distributed across ethnic, socio-economic, and geographic lines. Technology for learning, when deployed to all students, ensures that no student experiences a “21st-century skills and opportunity” gap.

Rural school districts can be creative in solving the internet connectivity gap—but they need support

More practically, technology has been shown to scale and sustain instructional practices that would be too resource-intensive to work in exclusively in-person learning environments, especially those with the highest needs. In multiple, large-scale studies where technology has been incorporated into the learning experiences of hundreds of students across multiple schools and school systems, they have been associated with better academic outcomes than comparable classrooms that did not include technology. Added to these larger bodies of research are dozens, if not hundreds, of smaller, more localized examples of technology being used successfully to improve students’ learning experiences. Further, meta-analyses and syntheses of the research show that blended learning can produce greater learning than exclusively in-person learning.
All of the above suggest that technology, used well, can drive equity in learning opportunities. We are seeing that students and families from privileged backgrounds are able to make choices about technology use that maximize its benefits and minimize its risks, while students and families from marginalized backgrounds do not have opportunities to make the same informed choices. Intentional, thoughtful inclusion of technology in public learning environments can ensure that all students, regardless of their ethnicity, socioeconomic status, language status, special education status, or other characteristics, have the opportunity to experience learning and develop skills that allow them to fully realize their potential.
The bad
On the other hand, the evidence is decidedly mixed on the neurological impact of technology use. In November 2016, the American Association of Pediatrics updated their screen time guidelines for parents, generally relaxing restrictions and increasing the recommended maximum amount of time that children in different age groups spend interacting with screens. These guidelines were revised not because of any new research, but for two far more practical reasons. First, the nuance of the existing evidence–especially the ways in which recommendations change as children get older–was not adequately captured in the previous guidelines. Second, the proliferation of technology in our lives had made the previous guidelines almost impossible to follow.
The truth is that infants, in particular, learn by interacting with our physical world and with other humans, and it is likely that very early (passive) interactions with devices–rather than humans–can disrupt or misinform neural development. As we grow older, time spent on devices often replaces time spent engaging in physical activity or socially with other people, and it can even become a substitute for emotional regulation, which is detrimental to physical, social, and emotional development.
In adolescence and young adulthood, the presence of technology in learning environments has also been associated with (but has not been shown to be the cause of) negative variables such as attention deficits or hyperactivity, feeling lonely, and lower grades. Multitasking is not something our brains can do while learning, and technology often represents not just one more “task” to have to attend to in a learning environment, but multiple additional tasks due to the variety of apps and programs installed on and producing notifications through a single device.
The pragmatic
The current takeaway from the research is that there are potential benefits and risks to deploying technology in learning environments. While we can’t wrap this topic up with a bow just yet–there are still more questions than answers–there is evidence that technology can amplify effective teaching and learning when in the hands of good teachers. The best we can do today is understand how technology can be a valuable tool for educators to do the complex, human work that is teaching by capitalizing on the benefits while remaining fully mindful of the risks as we currently understand them.
We must continue to build our understanding of both the risks and benefits as we proceed. With that in mind, here are some “Dos” and “Don’ts” for using technology in learning environments:

After a decade of turmoil, Greece is looking toward a better future—a future of economic recovery, lower unemployment and rising living standards. But 10 years is a long time in the world of technology. Recovery will make life better, but it will not take Greeks back to the pre-crisis world of the mid-2000s. As the Greek economy slid into recession, technological change in the world accelerated noticeably. Greece is returning to a global economy that has been radically transformed.

Before the economic crisis hit Greece, digital transformation and automation was a niche topic outside of a few countries like Japan. The world was in the midst of its last artificial intelligence (AI) winter. Europe was losing jobs to lower-wage economies in Asia, not to machines. Today, things are completely different. Digital technologies are disrupting the prospects for firms, workers, and consumers. Firms in the digital economy—often in the U.S. and China—are racking up record profits way in excess of Europe’s most productive global leaders in manufacturing. Jobs across Europe are increasingly about nonroutine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks that cannot easily be automated, and machines are gradually taking over manual and routine tasks.
Greece is no different, and its policymakers are contemplating how to take advantage of new opportunities, while managing the disruptive effects. They are dealing with questions that are not easy to answer. Will tech hold Greece back or accelerate its recovery? Does Greece have the wherewithal to thrive in a world of accelerating technological change?
Recent work by the World Bank gives some clues. Countries can thrive with technology if they boost opportunities for people to succeed in the new labor market and for firms to leverage tech for improved productivity. Opportunities for people come mainly through better education: higher enrollments and more graduates with the right skills. Opportunities for firms come through investments in connective infrastructure and broadband access. But firms also have to get aggressive about adopting new technology. For this, they need new managerial competencies and a business environment that encourages investment and innovation. The real question is: Does Greece have what it takes?
Opportunities for people
Greece’s position in education is relatively strong: 44 percent of 30- to 34-year-olds have a higher education degree, compared to the European Union average of 40 percent. Greece also has a tradition of science and technology; it has a relatively high share of STEM graduates, for example. But Greece has not managed to provide enough jobs for them. The result is that Greece has been exporting its talent, especially in tech, instead of allowing it to thrive at home. What’s worse, Greece is struggling to ensure that its future generations of workers have the right foundational skills. More than a third of Greek 15-year-olds failed to achieve basic proficiency in mathematics in the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). They are poorly prepared for the new tech-driven labor market and for lifelong learning (Figure 1).

Opportunities for firms
In the business environment, the situation in equally mixed. On the one hand, Greece has managed to engineer a quick catch-up to the EU leaders in broadband access. On the other, few firms are taking advantage of it for e-commerce and other tech-enabled operations. What’s more, Europe’s economies are seeing a widening productivity divide between large and small firms, as larger firms are quicker to adopt new technologies (Figure 2). Greece has an unusually large share of small firms and microenterprises, so it risks falling even farther behind. And much remains to be done in improving the general environment faced by Greek businesses. Greece still lags its OECD peers in the World Bank’s Doing Business assessment, and its labor taxes are among the highest in the OECD.

And yet, while the economic crisis ravaged Greece’s economy and traditional sectors, entrepreneurs in Athens have produced new tech success stories with global reach, such as the mobile platform Upstream, the recruitment software Workable, and the taxi app Beat recently acquired by a Daimler subsidiary and operating in capital cities in Latin America. Moreover, the tech sector’s innovative spirit is beginning to spill over into other sectors such as agriculture, where technology and modern farming practices have jump-started agricultural productivity on some Greek farms. Greece is also not a minor player in cutting-edge digital technology research and development in the EU. Greek enterprises, universities, and research institutions are prominent in Horizon 2020, the big EU program for research and technological development, placing Greece within the top seven countries in Horizon 2020-supported tech research and development in the EU.
What Greece now has to do
Greece can thrive with technology by leveraging its many strengths. This starts with mobilizing its large share of STEM graduates and linking them and their alma maters with the nascent tech sector. Global networks matter more than ever before. While Greece’s long-standing brain drain has worsened during the crisis years, its diaspora offers new opportunities for Greece’s tech sector to connect with entrepreneurs, investors, and scientists around the world.
But even as Greece sets its sights on a digital future, it needs to get its analog fundamentals right. It has to fix its school system to make sure that all students obtain the necessary foundation skills in reading, mathematics, science, and problem-solving. It has to improve the business environment, helping firms raise managerial skills and reducing labor taxes to incentivize firms to create more jobs. And it has to attract foreign direct investment in both manufacturing and services by reducing policy uncertainty.

The U.S. leads the global landscape in technology innovation. The country’s competitive edge, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Competitive Index, is due to its business dynamism, strong institutional pillars, financing mechanisms, and vibrant innovation ecosystem.1 Innovation is a trademark feature of American competitiveness and has powered its global dominance since the post-World-War industrial revolution. Countries that lead the world in generating advanced technologies and leveraging the full productive capacity of their digital economies can gain a strategic competitive advantage.
Figure 1: Global distribution of top 100 digital companies and market capitalization (US $billion)
Note: Market capitalization referenced in the figure are authors’ calculations. (Source: Murphy, A. (2018). The 2018 Digital 100. Retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreamurphy/2018/09/20/the-2018-digital-100/#289c85106137)
Digital technologies have risen to prominence as a critical determinant of economic growth, national security, and international competitiveness. The digital economy has a profound influence on the world’s trajectory and the societal well-being of ordinary citizens. It affects everything from resource allocation to income distribution and growth.
But how do we measure the digital economy and its contributions to growth and pertinent social indicators? Watanabe (2016), Brynjolfsson (2018), Nakamura (2018), Moulton (2018), and many other experts acknowledge the difficulty of precisely evaluating a digital economy characterized by rapidly changing products and services. Researchers estimate that “the digital economy is worth $11.5 trillion globally, equivalent to 15.5 percent of global GDP and has grown two and a half times faster than global GDP over the past 15 years.”2
For its part, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) attributes the challenges of measuring the digital economy to a lack of consensus around activities included in the definition and the rapid pace at which the underlying nature of digital technologies evolves. The BEA estimates that the U.S. digital economy grew at an annual average rate of 5.6 percent between 2006 and 2016 and “accounted for 6.5 percent of current-dollar GDP.”3
“Tracking the digital economy’s growth trajectory is essential because it serves as an integral forward-looking barometer of U.S. economic growth and international competitiveness.”
National statistical accounting challenges notwithstanding, tracking the digital economy’s growth trajectory is essential because it serves as an integral forward-looking barometer of U.S. economic growth and international competitiveness. Conceptually, the digital economy comprises goods and services that either were produced using digital technologies or include these technologies. The information and communications technology (ICT) industry stands at the center of much of this activity, underpinning the digital economy and serving as a reliable yardstick of its performance. Niebel (2018) confirms the link between ICT industry investments and economic growth, finding that between 1995 and 2010, “ICT contribute[d] substantially to economic growth” for developed, developing, and emerging countries.4
In the digital era, innovation, entrepreneurial dynamism, and information and ICT production will drive America’s competitive edge. The ICT industry and ICT-enabled industries make important contributions to economic growth. This paper attempts to value those contributions and benchmark the importance of the ICT sector in the U.S. economy by assessing its contributions to economic growth, job creation. The sector’s downstream contributions to the small business ecosystem and investments in reskilling and upskilling initiatives are examined. Finally, systemic challenges related to data privacy, trade, and immigration facing the sector are reviewed.
Benchmarking global competitiveness
Deep investments in ICT assets: Computer hardware, software, and internet, and broadband infrastructure, for example, are crucial determinants of growth in advanced economies. An OECD study by Vincenzo Spiezia posits that increased GDP growth and country-specific global competitiveness can be primarily attributed to growth rates in ICT investment.5 The impact of ICT assets, measured as the value of ICT-capital services as a percentage of GDP, is instructive in assessing the ICT sector’s full growth contribution. And on that front, the U.S. has secured a global lead, maintaining relatively strong competitiveness compared with other OECD member states. India and China have emerged as front-runners in this space, particularly with respect to the high levels of capital (or capital services) that ICT assets bring to GDP growth.
In addition to the demonstrated positive impact from ICT sectors on the total economy, a transformational shift has occurred from the ICT manufacturing sector to the ICT service sector. This move from a hardware- to software-centric level of growth has been particularly pronounced in developing countries due to deeper and wider mobile-cellular networks.6 Moreover, the maturing mobile ecosystem has been fueled by greater accessibility among mobile internet users and the affordability of smartphones and portable devices.

Beyond the increasing contributions of ICT-services to GDP growth, investments in the ICT sector have significantly boosted labor productivity.7 In this area, the U.S. economy has maintained its global leadership position with despite only incremental increase in wages from $62 per hour in 2005 to $71.2 per hour in 2015. China and India have also benefited from prior structural investments in ICT sectors, especially in terms of internet infrastructure and mobile operating platforms.
The McKinsey Global Institute notes the economies of scale that mobile users and the proliferation of e-commerce have brought to ICT sectors.8 These emerging developments have benefited from ICT investment and doubled labor productivity between 2005 and 2017. Conversely, such high levels of productivity have remained notably absent in most OECD member states; their median of labor productivity has only increased incrementally to $54 per hour despite holding historical advantages at $51 per hour.

Spending on R&D innovation has spurred labor productivity and the integration of ICT with the broader economy. The U.S. is a clear front-runner in this category: Total spending on R&D grew from $268.6 billion in 2000 to $496.6 billion by 2015 (Figure 4). While OECD peer countries increased their spending during this period only incrementally, India and China have made substantial R&D investments (in terms of total dollar amount)—eclipsing the investment totals of all other nations. India’s spending on R&D tripled, whereas China’s spending increased more than tenfold. These substantial investments in innovation have bolstered the swift transformation of these countries’ economies.

[Data file and codebook] Retrieved from https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/digest/sections/global-r-d-one-measure-of-commitment-to-innovation)In light of these developments, the U.S. and other OECD members should continue to prioritize investment in ICT at the state and local levels to maintain global competitiveness and boost labor productivity. Targeted ICT investments in 5G technologies and infrastructure along with R&D innovation combine to bolster the digital economy and accelerate the ICT-sector’s diffusion effect to less technologically-intensive sectors. Policy-guided investments can augment the capital contributions that ICT sectors make toward GDP growth and will boost labor productivity as a result.
Taking all these factors into account, it is evident that the IT industry is central to the digital pivot for developed and developing countries. In the U.S., the industry’s share of real economic growth has risen steadily since 2007, propelling the sector to relative prominence. Accelerated adoption of rapidly developing technologies such as cloud computing, robotic automation, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, the internet of things (IoT), and 5G technologies is promising for the IT industry and should promote ongoing growth.
U.S. information technology sector
Within and outside information technology (IT), the U.S. has delivered slow and steady economic growth since emerging from the financial crisis. U.S. GDP growth averaged 2.3 percent between 2010 and 2018, according to BEA figures. Diving below aggregate GDP statistics reveals a diverging growth story within which the services-producing sector headlines as a growth protagonist. Services-producing industries, which account for more than 80 percent of total output, have anchored much of U.S. economic performance and post-crisis recovery.
The IT industry is growing in dominance within the services-producing sector, powered in large part by a vibrant technology sector. But the industry is relatively small in absolute size, accounting for only 6 percent of the total economy, says BEA.

The ICT sector is a growth powerhouse, despite its diminutive stature. Over the last four years, the industry has driven remarkable gains, powering real economic growth and employment. The proliferation of digital technologies will continue to bring unprecedented structural changes to the U.S. economy, cementing the IT industry’s position as a leading source of growth and employment. Yet exactly how the IT industry will shape various aspects of the economy remains difficult to predict.
What is clear, is that the IT industry has expanded since the Great Recession, outpacing the value-add contributions of goods-producing industries to gross domestic output (Figure 5). Declining prominence in goods-producing sectors is not exclusive to the U.S., in fact this trajectory is consistent with similar trends in OECD peer countries and other advanced economies.
More broadly, the IT industry is an important contributor to the burgeoning digital economy and feeds the domestic economy through two primary channels: the production of cutting-edge technologies and the distribution of scale of innovation across other economic sectors. The IT services sector distributes innovative technologies from consulting services to downstream business organizations seeking to improve efficiency, generating significant multiplier effects across the industry value chain. IT spending on services, infrastructure, and software is on track to rise to $3.8 trillion, according to Gartner’s forecast, a 3.2 percent increase from $3.7 trillion in 2018.9
The IT industry is also impressively robust. It persevered through the U.S. economy’s slow recovery, growing from an annual value-add of $835 billion in 2008 to $1,480 billion in 2017—an increase of 77 percent (Table 1). The services-producing sector, though much larger, grew 20 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, the goods-producing sector posted a modest 5 percent increase to real economic growth.

In 2017 alone, the IT industry’s contribution to real economic output exceeded that of the professional and business services, finance and insurance, and manufacturing sectors, according to BEA figures on industry contributions to GDP. Although the industry has inspired sweeping business model changes and produced considerable business value across the value chain, the effects of mounting IT investment spending will likely be dampened by rapidly decreasing costs of technological solutions, driven largely by automation. Despite the changing cost structure of the technological distribution channel, growing IT spending should continue to have a net positive impact on the industry and on aggregate real economic output.
Industry composition and anticipated trends
Analyzing aggregate growth trends in the IT industry provides a useful but incomplete picture of the sub-industries that are critical to its growth and the broader economy. The industry is composed of three major sub-industry groups with related yet distinct core production activities: semi-conductors and semi-conductor equipment, software and services, and technological hardware and equipment.
Examining disaggregated growth patterns within the IT industry can clarify how prior performance has underpinned its overall trajectory. According to BEA figures, the broadcasting and telecommunications industry is the largest in absolute size but generated 14 percent of the IT industry’s growth gain between 2007 and 2017—the lowest rate for all sub-groups. By contrast, the data processing, internet publishing, and publishing industries (including software) produced tremendous growth rates that belie their size. The data processing, internet publishing, and other information services sector increased its contribution to GDP threefold between 2007 and 2017, ballooning from a value-add of $65.2 billion to $263.6 billion. Meanwhile, the publishing industries sector (including software) saw its share of real economic growth rise by 39 percent.
“An increasingly digital economy, driven by non-physical outputs (e.g., service delivery, software, and computing), will be the centerpiece of the U.S.’s global competitive advantage.”
An increasingly digital economy, driven by non-physical outputs (e.g., service delivery, software, and computing), will be the centerpiece of the U.S.’s global competitive advantage. However, quantifying precise value-add contributions is difficult under the current growth accounting framework. Classifying ICT services is especially challenging, as grouping this sub-industry’s primary production activities blurs the lines between services provided and technology produced.
Data processing, internet publishing, and other information services are the fastest-growing segments of services-producing industries. Rapid adoption and commercialization of digital technologies in non-ICT industries, which have inspired substantial productivity gains, may also lead to severe underappraisal of the value-add contribution of the IT industry and its overall employment gains.
The demand for IT-based services is disproportionate across many industry verticals; however, certain sectors present appealing opportunities for revenue generation for IT service providers. Whereas aggregate IT spending is expected to rise on a global scale, growth will be unevenly distributed across key geographical markets: North America (the U.S. and Canada); the Asia-Pacific region; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Latin America.

North America will constitute the bulk of worldwide IT expenditures from 2015–2019 and is expected to gross more than $1 trillion in spending in 2019. The EMEA region is estimated to be the second-largest source of regional spending, with Asia-Pacific coming in third due to a contraction in growth in most Asian economies.11
Enterprise software is forecasted to be the predominant driver of growth in overall IT spending in 2019 at 8.3 percent, followed by IT services at 4.7 percent.12 Devices, a segment driven by an increase in the average selling prices of mobile phones, will experience moderate growth (2.4 percent) in 2019, a slight downturn from 3.6 percent in 2018. Counterintuitively, data centers and communication services will exhibit the most sluggish growth of all segments (1.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively) in 2019, declining sharply from the preceding year (6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively).13
Emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain will continue to influence the IT industry into 2022. While growth in expenditures on traditional technologies (hardware, software, services, and telecom) is expected to largely mimic the single-digit GDP growth over this period, growth in advanced technologies is anticipated to be much more prolific, stretching into the double digits and commanding an increasingly greater share of total IT spending.14
“As spending on legacy technology systems declines, growth will be driven by key platforms: cloud, mobile, social and big data, and analytics.”
As spending on legacy technology systems declines, growth will be driven by key platforms: cloud, mobile, social and big data, and analytics. A growing share of technology spending will be diverted toward newer capabilities such as AI, robotics, and augmented reality, fueled in part by the cost savings generated by cloud-based technology and automation.15 The business industry’s shift toward innovation and growth from cost reduction has been fueled by ongoing modernization and wider accessibility to cloud-based services. According to a recent Deloitte survey on everything-as-a-service (XaaS) capabilities, “For companies in which more than three-quarters of the enterprise IT is XaaS, and in companies that have been using flexible consumption for more than three years, ‘accelerated innovation’ has overtaken ‘reduced costs’ as a key priority for their XaaS initiatives.”
A spike in consumer demand for flexible pay-as-you-go models coupled with large IT companies integrating costly cloud-based tools with enterprise systems has brought the cloud to the mass market. Consequently, high-end technologies such as AI and IoT—tools normally restricted to a select few large companies and innovative startups—have been made available to a range of small, medium, and large-sized firms.16
AI has spearheaded this explosive trend; large companies have sought to integrate AI into cloud-based technologies and have delivered these tools on a mass scale. This evolution has cemented the status of cloud and other software-as-a-service capabilities as a core platform for growth within IT-service-based and business industries.17
This shift toward innovation is no more evident than in the rapid proliferation of enterprise software systems, projected to be the fastest-growing IT segment worldwide in 2019. The convergence around this inflection point toward enterprise cloud-based digital transformation and innovation will remain a key source of opportunity for IT-service-based providers.
Automation will undoubtedly shape the IT industry’s future as well. Automation offers the potential to improve productivity by introducing robots and AI into the workplace. These tools will help employees complete more tasks and leverage human capabilities. Automated processes and digital assistants can also facilitate worker productivity, bringing substantial benefits to the macroeconomy.
These developments are promising for productivity, but their impacts on workers remain to be seen. Organizations may be able to do more with fewer people. If that happens, society at large could be threatened as fewer workers would be needed to service the economy; if companies can get by with fewer employees, job prospects will certainly be affected.
New jobs will undoubtedly be created in this scenario, and the demand for data sciences, coding, digital platforms, and e-commerce will grow—but aside from delivery jobs, it will be difficult for affected workers to develop the skills needed in these areas. The mismatch between skills required and workers’ capabilities will necessitate the expansion of worker retraining programs. 
Distributing ICT impact
The rapid rise of the digital age and the IT sector has shaped nearly all contours of the U.S. economy, helping to fuel upstream and downstream growth in employment and productivity, small businesses, and corporate investments in workforce training for the digital age.
Since 2006, the IT industry has experienced drastic shifts in its conventional to current form of production and related service delivery. The BEA has recognized this change and, under its newly released account of the digital economy, introduced a sub-category called the “IT and Related Industry” to capture the growing overlap between information services and professional service delivery.

Technology and the future of growth: Challenges of change

According to the BEA, employment in the IT and IT-related industry has grown substantially. Annual growth figures, except during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 to 2009, expanded at almost twice the rate of the total employment market from 2006 to 2016.18 The highest annual growth rate reached over 4.1 percent in 2014, double the employment growth rate of the total economy in the same year.
Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics regarding projected employment in the year 2026, service-providing industries are expected to account for the majority of 11.5 million newly created jobs.19 Among the top five fastest-growing industries over the next decade, the IT-related industry holds two positions: Professional and business services together with professional, scientific, and technical services will account for 15.4 percent of projected new jobs.
In addition, the total U.S. economy is anticipated to expand job opportunities at a compound annual increase of 0.7 percent from 2016 to 2026. The professional and business service industry will be a burgeoning driver in creating potential job opportunities at a compound annual increase of 1 percent during this time frame. Jobs within the traditional IT industry are only projected to grow at a compound annual increase of 0.2 percent by comparison, slower than average within the total economy.
ICT powering jobs
The IT industry was the most promising domain with respect to job creation between 2006 and 2016. The industry’s employment growth trajectory becomes more apparent through a disaggregated picture at the sub-industry level, which reveals incremental shifts within the total sector, especially in professional service delivery.
BEA defines the professional service delivery sector as comprising the three main segments: 1) legal services; 2) computer systems design and related services; and 3) miscellaneous professional, scientific, and technical services. On aggregates, the professional services sector significantly expanded between 2006 and 2017. Conventional legal services sector posted slower growth rates, whereas the other two sub-sectors grew considerably, particularly the computer system design and related services industry. Such growth led to a near doubling of job creation numbers during the same period.20
Job growth patterns at the sub-industry level highlight IT service delivery as a major contributing factor to the professional service delivery sector. Job growth in this sector also signifies further integration of the IT service industry with other-sector economic activities. This trend exemplifies the role of the IT service delivery industry in supplying services to other sectors and its influence on the expansion of the U.S. job market. 
Productivity impact
In addition to the employment boost provided by the IT and related industry, associated industry productivity has grown as well. The average GDP output per employee in the IT and related industry was more than twice the average productivity of the total economy from 2006 to 2016. Based on estimates of BEA figures, annual GDP output per employee within the IT and related industry increased from $321,659 to $408,129. Meanwhile, GDP output per employee within the total economy only increased from $120,876 to $132,873 during the same time.21
When examining productivity of the IT and related industry, it is important to include its digital spillover value towards non-ICT industries. Huawei and Oxford Economics (2018) assert that a robust digital economy includes direct digital products along with digital spillovers from primary digital industries to secondary, non-digital industries. In such an accounting framework, Huawei and Oxford argue that “digital spillovers” should play a key role in estimating the true productive capacity of a digital economy.22 A prime example of increasing integration between the ICT and non-ICT sectors is the ICT sector’s consistent contribution to the productive capacity of other sectors; between 2006 and 2016, the ICT industry accounted for more than 11 percent of the total supply of commodities and services within the U.S.
Despite its relatively small size as measured by GDP output statistics, the ICT industry has played an instrumental role in driving economic growth and employment within the U.S. economy.
Downstream impact on the small business ecosystem
A dynamic ICT industry serves as a prominent growth mechanism in the small business ecosystem, delivering downstream value and boosting productivity. Small business enterprises (SBEs), defined as companies with fewer than 500 employees, are the backbone of the U.S. economy and account for more than 99.7 percent of the 5.6 million U.S. employer firms, comprising an essential constituent of the IT industry.23
Through varied platforms and cost-effective access to cutting-edge technologies, small businesses have the foundational support to spur innovation, commercial collaboration, and important knowledge transfers within the small business sector. These benefits will emerge in more pronounced ways as newer digital technologies (e.g., cloud-based services) mature and penetrate non-ICT segments.
More traditional tech tools, such as mobile applications, will also grow to critical mass in the small business value chain. This proliferation of modern tech-based solutions is key; according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Q-2 2018 Small Business Index, “Companies that feel ahead of the technological curve are more likely to feel better about their business and cash flow and are planning to hire at a higher rate.”

Tools such as cloud computing, big data, and customer-relationship management systems are similarly central to tech-optimism. Not only do these innovations help businesses assimilate into the digital ecosystem, but small businesses’ willingness to invest in these capabilities and other IT-related services exposes them to better local market opportunities and profit margins.
Additionally, according to a survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, higher technology adoption rates are tied to confidence in small business health and cash flow—essential conditions for successful scaling in the small business ecosystem. SBEs, driven in part by their readiness to spend on IT services and infrastructure, will emerge as an important consumer constituent to the ICT services industry.
ICT software and platform infrastructure are providing unprecedented opportunities for small businesses to scale without the commonly accompanying price tag; historically, these factors represented major barriers to technological adoption in small business markets. Recently, however, a mass transition to cloud-hosted accounting software applications unfolded within the small business ecosystem and laid the groundwork for other systems’ entrance thanks to cloud-based applications.
Cloud-based technologies represent another game-changing opportunity for small businesses, offering access to new markets and bringing unexpected benefits to the value chain. Lund and Tyson (2018) point out that the benefits of digital technologies in the small business ecosystem carry implications for global trade patterns. They further contend that online marketplaces/platforms are critical mechanisms for trade growth, especially as smaller transactions increase in scale and relevance for economic growth. The evolutionary rise of micro-multinational enterprises with access to new markets has been made possible thanks to retail intermediaries such as Amazon in the U.S. and Alibaba in China, which host 2.0 million and 10.0 million third-party sellers (micro-multinational enterprises), respectively.
“Cloud-based technologies represent another game-changing opportunity for small businesses, offering access to new markets and bringing unexpected benefits to the value chain.”
Cloud-based technologies also hold great promise for the small business ecosystem as a defining digital technology with a demonstrated capacity to positively disrupt the value chain. In a survey assessing small business openness to cloud computing technologies in Australia, Fakieh et al. (2016) observed that small companies were motivated to adopt cloud-based technologies because of cost savings for firms with limited budgets and substantial returns on productivity and business outcomes.24 Additionally, the authors note that affordable cloud computing technologies are essential to boosting SME productivity and business outcomes. According to Cisco’s Global Cloud Index, private and public cloud workloads are expected to increase appreciably by 2021 and to grow by compounded annual growth rates of 27 and 73 percent, respectively.25 The Global Cloud Index expects software-as-a-service (SaaS) to be the primary driver behind cloud-service delivery models; in fact, SaaS is expected to account for 75 percent of global cloud workloads by 2021.
SaaS and platform-as-a-service will also facilitate the transformation of big data, AI, and machine learning analytics into accessible technologies for small businesses. Luo and Bu (2015) state, “ICT significantly facilitates effective knowledge sharing and knowledge integration, which further bolsters value chain integration and synergy development among primary and support activities of a value-chain system.”26 A stream of emerging research continues to add credible evidence to the role of the ICT sector as a growth-enabling channel that enhances small business productivity, competitiveness, and ultimate value-add to domestic economic growth.
ICT sector shaping the future of work
ICT technologies are essential productivity and growth inputs, but fully exploiting the potential of digital technologies is predicated on a capable workforce that can convert technical knowledge into productive outputs. Growth trends in ICT sectors worldwide and a highly skilled workforce shape management decisions when choosing corporate headquarters and manufacturing centers. For example, in an interview with Fortune Global Forum, Apple CEO Tim Cook emphasized the importance of a highly skilled workforce in attracting manufacturing business:
“China has moved into very advanced manufacturing, so you find in China the intersection of craftsman kind of skill, and sophisticated robotics and the computer science world. That intersection, which is very rare to find anywhere, that kind of skill, is very important to our business because of the precision and quality level that we like.”27
Cook’s rationale for selecting China as Apple’s manufacturing home base for the iPhone was more about China’s skilled workforce—in terms of quality and quantity—than the low cost of labor. Cook argues that in China, “You could fill multiple football fields” with tooling engineers; in the U.S., however, “I’m not sure we could fill the room.” Cook connects the competitive advantage of China’s skilled workforce to a longstanding priority on applied vocational training within the country’s education system. Building a highly skilled workforce is vital to maximizing the ICT sector’s productivity growth potential and sustaining America’s global competitive advantage.
Workforce challenges are most acute for the ICT industry given its growth trajectory and leadership on the digital technology frontier. Arguably, the sector is at the forefront of 21st-century human capital challenges, including skill mismatches, skilled-worker shortages, and attracting and retaining highly skilled workers in tight labor markets. According to the World Economic Forum, “By 2022, no fewer than 54 percent of all employees will require significant reskilling and upskilling.”28
While broadening technological adoption has been tied to industry growth, the widening collection of digital technologies compounds these labor market trends. Increased access to IT infrastructure and digital technologies continues to shape workforce needs within the IT industry as well as non-IT sectors. As a consequence, organizations are rapidly integrating emerging technologies into their business processes and accelerating the transformation of their workforce needs.
Beyond large enterprises such as General Electric Company, Verizon, and Lockheed Martin, each of which is making substantial investments to upskill and retrain their workforce, a large gap remains in robust workforce preparedness across the industry. According to Towers Watson, “90 percent of maturing companies expect digital disruption, but only 44 percent are adequately preparing for it.”29
Nonetheless, those that are making significant strides to address human capital challenges are doing so through a combination of the following approaches: 1) retraining their existing workforce; 2) defining new skill sets and recruiting fresh talent to fill emerging gaps in business; and 3) leveraging automation.30

Amidst a “reskilling revolution,” hiring and developing a company’s talent pool from within, rather than competing with large industry peers and smaller innovative companies, has been increasingly lauded as the new “recruiting tool” and a more effective model to bridge the technical skills gap. Retraining existing talent rather than relying on external hiring is less costly; turnover costs can equal as much as 16 percent of an hourly-waged employee’s compensation or 213 percent of the salary for a highly trained position.31 Additionally, retraining allows companies to build upon their workforce’s institutional knowledge and not lose valuable time waiting for newly acquired workers to adjust to company practices.
In many instances, the rapid evolution of digital technologies shortens the effective shelf-life of technical skills, which complicates the debate on identifying a cogent national workforce strategy to address skill shortages. In the meantime, relying on internal reskilling programs represents an anodyne response to the growing concern of skills mismatch in the intensely competitive ICT sector that allows industry leaders to boost market competitiveness. However, program adoption is unevenly distributed across the ICT sector, and many companies continue to rely on a mix of workforce strategies to assuage workforce challenges.
AT&T has emerged as an industry leader in workforce retraining initiatives and has adopted two main strategies to equip 95 percent of its workforce with highly sought-after skills by 2020.32 First, it has invested in creating new career pipelines to attract entry-level talent. Second, it has invested in a variety of training schemes, including a $1 billion web-based global retraining program comprised of online courses; academic-degree-based partnerships with Coursera and leading universities such as Georgia Tech; and an online portal that allows employees to follow a career road map to transition into new roles.
AT&T’s investments have been paying off: Employees who are retraining are twice as likely to be hired into advanced emerging occupations (e.g., data scientists) and four times as likely to advance in their careers. AT&T’s success in and commitment to building an internal program rather than relying on external hiring has become a model for other IT leaders who are slowly adopting the same approach.
Similarly, IBM has committed $1 billion to training and development programs for its U.S-based employees over the next four years.33 However, the company’s initiatives are unique in its attempts to make career inroads into the IT industry more accessible to a wider pool of candidates rather than a select few. First, the company has issued over a million digital badges in every country–digital credentials that showcase completion of a class or training and serve as a signal to IBM and the broader labor market of newly acquired skills. Second, IBM is recruiting highly skilled candidates through its “New Collar Certificate Program” by placing a premium on sought-after skills as opposed to formal academic credentials like a four-year degree. Regardless of where the skills were attained (i.e., at a coding boot camp or community college), there will be roles at the company for these applicants as long as they possess the requisite capabilities.
Ultimately, due to the nature of contemporary jobs and the diversity of workplace settings, online learning content and micro-learning are sure to become increasingly popular among organizations to boost business value in the digital economy.
Future challenges
Regulatory uncertainty and the rise of massive security breaches present major challenges for the IT industry moving forward. The proliferation of AI, machine learning, and robotic automation technologies across leading IT service companies supports the industry’s robust outlook. However, widespread security concerns place millions of consumers and the small business ecosystem at risk. What’s more, the radical shift in political attitudes around critical domestic issues (particularly trade and immigration) calls the industry’s future into question. Ambiguities around data privacy, cybersecurity, and trade warrant particular attention.
Data privacy
Political tides are influencing the ICT industry with regard to data protection and broader concerns. In terms of regulations, escalating trade tariff frictions between the U.S. and China concerning trade imbalances have deflected attention from the silent rise of regional data protectionist policies. In 2018, China, India, and Vietnam introduced data protectionist legislation to circumscribe cross-border data flow.
These sovereign governments have pointed to data protection as paramount in mandating local storage of consumer data. Regardless of the motivating factors, such restrictions limit the free flow of data across international borders with important consequences for the IT industry. Potential outcomes include increased compliance risks, growing infrastructure costs to maintain fractionalized enterprise data storage systems, and a corresponding rise in investments to navigate transient compliance requirements.
“Digital privacy protection is of critical importance in a vibrant digital society that respects consumers’ rights to control access to their data and balances safeguards within an ecosystem that supports innovation and growth.”
Digital privacy protection is of critical importance in a vibrant digital society that respects consumers’ rights to control access to their data and balances safeguards within an ecosystem that supports innovation and growth. However, the pace of massive data breaches has eclipsed regulators’ ability to constrain these events and improve institutional accountability.
The lack of a cogent national regulatory framework to address data privacy challenges emerging from massive amounts of business and consumer-related data, coupled with shifts in individuals’ privacy preferences, presents inherent threats to the IT industry. Operational planning is particularly at risk. The absence of clear, consistent signals from federal authorities on the future of data privacy regulation in the U.S. could be costly for the IT industry, along with non-IT stakeholders. Nevertheless, two regulatory models provide insight into future directions for an eventual U.S. policy on digital privacy.
Globally, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a regulatory model that, at its core, aims to protect consumers and increase control over their personal data via informed consent. GDPR also incentivizes enterprise compliance and accountability through punitive fines.
Domestically, the state of California has emerged as a vanguard in data protection, promulgating The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as a legislative response to data privacy concerns. CCPA closely parallels GDPR’s structural design and reliance on penalties for non-compliance. GDPR and CCPA also converge on the importance of data privacy for consumers. Despite obvious consumer benefits, these regulatory regimes present substantial non-compliance risks for the IT industry in terms of pecuniary harms and reputational damage.
Trade and immigration tensions
The political landscape also carries major implications for global trade and the flow of workers across borders, heightening the complexities associated with cross-border movements of diverse forms of capital. National political arguments prioritizing domestic economic interests have supplanted transnational and global cooperative relationships that have been the hallmark of trade norms for the last several decades. Conversations around cross-border movement are now generating tangible policies rather than abstract political discussion. The recent partial shutdown of the U.S. government offers worrisome evidence of this shift and exacerbates financial instability as a consequence of the U.S.–China trade wars, which have adversely affected financial markets around the world.
What’s more, anti-immigrant populist sentiment influenced the Brexit referendum vote, which mandated the U.K.’s exit from the European Union. Beyond the destabilizing economic uncertainty stemming from this vote and subsequent political stalemate around plans to implement a required exit, the anti-immigration agenda was clear. Immigration friction sentiments formed a critical flashpoint of the Brexit discourse, one that has since been replicated in the German and U.S. elections.
Besides this, negative sentiments toward immigrant labor have shaped political debates and national policies that promote closing borders to important labor flows of highly skilled immigrants. Recently, through a series of legislation under the “Buy American/Hire American” executive order, the U.S. has applied greater scrutiny and more stringent requirements to employment-based immigration (specifically the H-1B temporary foreign worker visa). These impending laws are expected to disproportionately affect the ICT industry. According to the Department of Labor’s H1-B visa statistics, 57.6 percent of certified positions for FY 2018 were related to jobs in computer programming and software development fields; in FY 2017, computer-related occupations accounted for 70 percent of successfully awarded visa applications.
On Feb. 22, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security proposed a ban on the work authorization of 100,000 H-4 visa holders—a special work authorization for spouses/children of H-1B visa holders who are awaiting permanent residency status—reducing the attractiveness of the U.S. to foreign workers and their dependent families. With foreign workers and H-1B holders constituting most of the talent pool in large tech companies, such a development could greatly disrupt companies’ business models and workforce strategies. Final implementation is uncertain given anticipated legal challenges to the proposed rule.
Furthermore, recently implemented administrative changes to the H-1B visa lottery compound the effects of anti-immigrant labor market policies. Despite the unknown final impact of the lottery change, summarily these rules and regulations alter competitive dynamics among highly skilled workers. By reducing the dominance of large IT staffing firms (e.g., Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro) in employment-visa based petitions with candidates who fail to fit “highly skilled occupational requirements,” many major tech firms will lose out on a valuable talent source of permanent and temporary workers. To that end, heightened workforce pressures across the ICT industry will likely cause many IT firms to relocate more operations offshore to compensate for the shortfall in domestic-based foreign talent if workforce training efforts cannot meet the industry’s demand for highly skilled workers.
Conclusion
The IT industry is shaping the U.S. economy in several important ways, most notably with respect to sectoral innovation, economic growth, overall business operations, and regulatory policy. It is clear that the industry, despite its relative immaturity compared with more established sectors, will remain a key player in the nation’s economic landscape. However, its prospects are tempered by looming issues related to international affairs.
“It is clear that the IT industry, despite its relative immaturity compared with more established sectors, will remain a key player in the nation’s economic landscape.”
In the long run, closing borders presents significant risks to the IT industry and may come at the expense of the industry’s innovation, competitiveness, and capacity to develop and distribute products and services. Ensuing responses to the turbulence around trade wars, immigration, and cross-border communication will guide the industry’s development in potentially drastic ways. Such changes, however difficult they are to forecast, will likely bring ripple effects to IT and related industry as well as the economy at large. Industry experts should thus continue to monitor developments in IT and adjacent areas carefully to safeguard its evolution, provide targeted workforce recommendations, and devise appropriate protectionary measures for businesses and consumers.

TikTok and WeChat, two hugely successful Chinese social media applications that have gained global popularity, abruptly find their access to the U.S. consumer market at risk. In August, President Donald Trump ordered TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell its product to a U.S. company within 90 days. He simultaneously banned Tencent, the owner of WeChat, from most of its operations in the United States.

The administration has targeted these two apps, but with somewhat different purposes in mind. TikTok has a global following that already numbers 800 million users, and has ample allure to potential American bidders, including Microsoft and Oracle, with an estimated market value of $20-30 billion. WeChat is an all-purpose app within China and abroad, encompassing gossip, sanctioned and unsanctioned news reporting, online payment systems, and contact between Chinese living abroad and their families and friends at home.
The Trump administration sees malicious uses underlying dependence on both apps. According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, utilizing Chinese social media tools leaves massive amounts of personal data vulnerable to exploitation by Chinese intelligence, though both parent companies deny these allegations. The U.S. claims that dangers to U.S. national security justify efforts to disconnect Chinese carriers from America’s telecommunications networks. Few non-government analysts can properly evaluate these allegations, and the government has disclosed little information to substantiate its claims.
Chinese officials view these pending restraints as part of a larger effort to deny Chinese firms access to the U.S. market, thereby impeding their continued advance and circumscribing future commercial opportunities. In response, Beijing is threatening to block the sale of TikTok’s assets by withholding approval of Chinese export licenses for sale of China’s commercial technologies to U.S. firms. China’s Ministry of Commerce has also announced new restrictions on the export of technologies that can be used for analyzing personal information. In the competitive world of social media and e-commerce, Chinese companies grasp that turnabout is fair play, and that they are not without leverage.

Slowdown in the People’s Republic of China


						Edited by Justin Yifu Lin, Peter J. Morgan, and Guanghua Wan

These moves reveal an intensifying U.S.-China technological divide, with both countries proposing separate models of global digital governance. The Trump administration has enunciated plans for a “clean network,” and all measures exclusively target China. In response, China has unveiled its own proposal for data security standards, based on “cyber sovereignty.” This would enable individual countries to regulate and control their uses of the internet.
The U.S.’s threat-driven narrative of China now goes well beyond Trump’s long-standing obsession with trade imbalances, though these remain a core part of his message. After protracted negotiations, the two countries signed a phase one trade agreement in January 2020, obligating China to make large-scale purchases of U.S. agricultural products and manufactured goods. Trump saw the agreement as vindicating his belief in managed trade, but — partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic — the accord has done little to narrow the trade imbalance.  Moreover, his unilateral imposition of new tariffs, initiated in  2018, failed to recognize that China would impose retaliatory tariffs of its own. Trump remains unwilling or unable to grasp that tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers and U.S. companies, representing a dual liability to the United States.
The investment outlook is even more sobering. Chinese outbound investment to the United States surged to record highs in 2016, but has since plummeted to 2010 levels. The expectation that increasing integration between the world’s two largest economies would provide much needed ballast for the bilateral relationship does not apply in an administration dominated by economic nationalists hostile to interdependence.
In the longer run, the administration seems intent on strategic separation and economic decoupling from China, especially in high technology areas. This includes Huawei, a leader in telecommunications gear and already well advanced in its 5G ambitions. The United States is pressuring its closest allies to sever or at least sharply curtail their links with Huawei, which it deems a major national security threat and commercial challenger. New U.S. regulations prohibiting the sale of U.S. chips to Huawei for smartphone manufacturing will deny Huawei the ability to compete once its existing inventory of chips is exhausted. But it provides a powerful impetus for China to devote major resources to the indigenous development of advanced chips.
Punitive sanctions are an additional weapon in the administration’s arsenal. These are aimed at senior Chinese officials held responsible for policies that the United States deems objectionable or illegal, at commercial entities accused of technology theft, and at firms with substantial assets in the United States. Such measures are expected to inflict pain on China, though it seems likely to spur Beijing to pursue closer ties with major trade partners other than the United States.
It is also unclear how the administration expects these actions to induce longer-term Chinese behavior that would address U.S. grievances. Trump and his advisers seem to believe that punitive policies will slow China’s advance, and that characterizing China as the preeminent threat to the United States will benefit Trump’s re-election prospects. But the administration has given minimal consideration to the implications of an adversarial relationship with Beijing, or to the consequences of an increasingly fractured global economy as China increasingly goes its own way.
China’s experiences with the Trump administration have been deeply sobering to leaders in Beijing. No matter who is elected in November, China will seek to reduce its dependence on the United States and accelerate the development of indigenous technologies to protect the country from U.S. unpredictability and hostility. The next administration will need to ponder carefully whether a lasting U.S.-China technology divide will be in anyone’s long-term interest.

Algorithms:
According to author Pedro Domingos, algorithms are “a sequence of instructions telling a computer what to do.”[1] These software-based coding rules started with simple and routine tasks, but now have advanced into more complex formulations, such as providing driving instructions for autonomous vehicles, identifying possible malignancies in X-rays and CT scans, and assigning students to public schools. Algorithms are widely used in finance, retail, communications, national defense, and many other areas.
Artificial Intelligence (AI):
Indian engineers Shukla Shubhendu and Jaiswal Vijay define AI as “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment, and intention.”[2] This definition emphasizes several qualities that separate AI from mechanical devices or traditional computer software, specifically intentionality, intelligence, and adaptability. AI-based computer systems can learn from data, text, or images and make intentional and intelligent decisions based on that analysis.
Augmented Reality (AR):
Augmented reality puts people in realistic situations that are augmented by computer-generated video, audio, or sensory information. This kind of system allows people to interact with actual and artificial features, be monitored for their reactions, or be trained on the best ways to deal with various stimuli.
Big Data:
Extremely large data sets that are statistically analyzed to gain detailed insights. The data can involve billions of records and require substantial computer-processing power. Data sets are sometimes linked together to see how patterns in one domain affect other areas. Data can be structured into fixed fields or unstructured as free-flowing information. The analysis of big data sets can reveal patterns, trends, or underlying relationships that were not previously apparent to researchers.
Chatbots:
Automated tools for answering human questions. Chatbots are being used in retail, finance, government agencies, nonprofits, and other organizations to respond to frequently asked questions or routine inquiries.
Cloud Computing:
Data storage and processing used to take place on personal computers or local servers controlled by individual users. In recent years, however, storage and processing have migrated to digital servers hosted at data centers operated by internet platforms, and people can store information and process data without being in close proximity to the data center. Cloud computing offers convenience, reliability, and the ability to scale applications quickly.
Computer Vision (CV):
Computers that develop knowledge based on digital pictures or videos.[3] For example, cameras in automated retail outlets that are connected to CV systems can observe what products shoppers picked up, identify the specific items and their prices, and charge consumers’ credit card or mobile payment system without involving a cash register or sales clerk. CV also is being deployed to analyze satellite images, human faces, and video imagery.
Connected Vehicles:
Cars, trucks, and buses that communicate directly with one another and with highway infrastructure. This capacity speeds navigation, raises human safety, and takes advantage of the experiences of other vehicles on the road to improve the driving experience.
Data Analytics:
The analysis of data to gather substantive insights. Researchers use statistical techniques to find trends or patterns in the data, which give them a better understanding of a range of different topics. Data analytic approaches are used in many businesses and organizations to track day-to-day activities and improve operational efficiency.
Data Mining:
Techniques that analyze large amounts of information to gain insights, spot trends, or uncover substantive patterns. These approaches are used to help businesses and organizations improve their processes or identify associations that shed light on relevant questions.
Deepfakes:
Digital images and audio that are artificially altered or manipulated by AI and/or deep learning to make someone do or say something he or she did not actually do or say. Pictures or videos can be edited to put someone in a compromising position or to have someone make a controversial statement, even though the person did not actually do or say what is shown. Increasingly, it is becoming difficult to distinguish artificially manufactured material from actual videos and images.
Deep Learning:
A subset of machine learning that relies on neural networks with many layers of neurons. In so doing, deep learning employs statistics to spot underlying trends or data patterns and applies that knowledge to other layers of analysis. Some have labeled this as a way to “learn by example” and a technique that “perform[s] classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound” and then applies that knowledge independently.[4] Deep learning requires extensive computing power and labeled data, and is used in medical research, automated vehicles, electronics, and manufacturing, among other areas.
Digital Sovereigns:
The speed, scope, and timing of technology innovation today is often decided not by government officials but by coders, software designers, and corporate executives. Digital sovereigns set the rules of the road and terms of service for consumers. What they decide, directly or indirectly, has far-reaching consequences for those using their software or platform. The power of business decisionmakers raises important governance questions regarding who should decide on matters affecting society as a whole and the role that policymakers, consumers, and ethicists should play in digital innovation.
Distributed Collaboration:
Connecting frontline people with others who have differing skills and getting them to work together to solve problems. Distributed collaboration differs from current governance paradigms that emphasize hierarchical, top-down decisionmaking by those who do not always have relevant knowledge about the issues being addressed. The new model takes advantage of the fact that a range of skills are needed to resolve technology issues, and those skills are located in different subject areas and organizational parts. Rather than keeping AI expertise in isolation, distributed collaboration brings together software and product designers, engineers, ethicists, social scientists, and policymakers to draw on their respective expertise and integrate their knowledge to solve pressing problems.
Dual-Use Technologies:
Many technologies can be used in a good or ill manner. The very same facial recognition system could be used to find missing children or provide a means for mass surveillance. It is not the technology per se that raises ethical issues but how the technology is put to use. The dual-use nature of technologies makes regulation difficult because it raises the question of how to gain the benefits of technology innovation while avoiding its detrimental features.
Facial Recognition (FR):
A technology for identifying specific people based on pictures or videos. It operates by analyzing features such as the structure of the face, the distance between the eyes, and the angles between a person’s eyes, nose, and mouth. It is controversial because of worries about privacy invasion, malicious applications, or abuse by government or corporate entities. In addition, there have been well-documented biases by race and gender with some facial recognition algorithms.
5G Networks:
These are fifth-generation wireless telecommunications networks that have been deployed in major cities and feature faster speeds and enhanced capabilities for transmitting data and images. As such, 5G networks enable new digital products and services, such as video streaming, autonomous vehicles, and automated factories and homes that require a fast broadband.
Hyperwar:
High-tech military situations in which robots, sensors, AI, and autonomous systems play important roles and command decisions have to unfold at speeds heretofore unseen in warfare. Because of the acceleration of the pace and scope of conflict, countries will have to conduct simultaneous operations in every warfare domain and national leaders will need to accelerate technology innovation to build a safe and stable future.[5]
Machine Learning (ML):
According to Dorian Pyle and Cristina San Jose of the McKinsey Quarterly, machine learning is “based on algorithms that can learn from data without relying on rules-based programming.”[6] ML represents a way to classify data, pictures, text, or objects without detailed instruction and to learn in the process so that new pictures or objects can be accurately identified based on that learned information. ML furthermore can be used to estimate continuous variables (such as estimating home sales prices) or to play games. Many of its insights come by examining prior data and learning how to improve understanding.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
The analysis of textual information to make sense of its meaning and intentions. NLP software can take a large amount of text and see how words are linked together to assess positive or negative sentiment, relationships, associations, and meaning. For example, researchers can study medical records to see which patient symptoms appear to be most related to particular illnesses.
Neural Networks:
Researchers use computer software to “perform some task by analyzing training examples” and by grouping data based on common similarities.[7] Similar to the neural nodes of a brain, neural networks learn in layers and build complex concepts out of simpler ones. They break up tasks, identify objects at a number of different levels, and apply that knowledge to other activities. These kinds of systems allow computers to learn and adapt to changing circumstances, similar to the way a brain functions. Deep learning and many of the most prominent recent applications of machine learning operate through neural networks (e.g., driverless cars, deepfakes, and AlphaGo game playing).
Quantum Computing:
Quantum computers have tremendous capacity for storing and processing information because their storage processes are not in the form of a zero or one, as is the case with traditional computers. Rather, they take advantage of superposition—the fact that electrons can be in two places at once—to create “quantum bits” that store multiple values in each point.[8] That capability dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times, thereby improving the scope of data, textual, or image analysis.
Singularity:
Futurist Ray Kurzweil describes a singularity as a “machine-based superintelligence [that is] greater than human intelligence.”[9] It combines advanced computing power with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create super-powered entities. There are extensive (and unresolved) debates regarding whether humanity will face a computing singularity in the next 50, 100, or 250 years.
Social Credit Systems:
The ubiquity of people’s online activities enables technology that tracks behavior and rates people based on their online actions. As an illustration, some organizations have piloted systems that compile data on social media activities, personal infractions, and behaviors such as paying taxes on time. They use that data to rate people for creditworthiness, travel, school enrollment, and government positions.[10] These systems are problematic from an ethical standpoint because they lack transparency and can be used to penalize political opponents.
Supervised Learning:
According to Science magazine, supervised learning is “a type of machine learning in which the algorithm compares its outputs with the correct outputs during training. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm merely looks for patterns in a set of data.”[11] Supervised learning allows ML and AI to improve information processing and become more accurate.
Techlash:
The backlash against emerging technologies that has developed among many individuals. People worry about a host of problems related to technology innovation, such as privacy invasions, mass surveillance, widening income inequality, and possible job losses. Figuring out how to assuage understandable human fears is a major societal challenge going forward.
Virtual Reality (VR):
Virtual reality uses headsets equipped with projection visors to put people in realistic-seeming situations that are completely generated by computers. People can see, hear, and experience many types of environments and interact with them. By simulating actual settings, VR can train people how to deal with various situations, vary the features that are observed, and monitor how people respond to differing stimuli.

Economic growth has been lackluster for more than a decade now. This has occurred at a time when economies have faced much unfolding change. What are the forces of change, how are they affecting the growth dynamics, and what are the implications for policy? A recently published book, “Growth in a Time of Change,” addresses these questions.	






Zia Qureshi
Visiting Fellow - Global Economy and Development





Three basic ingredients drive economic growth—productivity, capital, and labor. All three are facing new challenges in a changing context. Foremost among the drivers of change has been technology, spearheaded by digital transformation.
Slowdown in productivity and investment
Productivity is the main long-term propeller of economic growth. Technology-enabled innovation is the major spur to productivity growth. Yet, paradoxically, productivity growth has slowed as digital technologies have boomed. Among advanced economies over the past 15 years or so, it has averaged less than half of the pace of the previous 15 years. Firms at the technological frontier have reaped major productivity gains, but the impact on productivity more widely across firms has been weak. The new technologies have tended to produce winners-take-most outcomes. Dominant firms have acquired more market power, market structures have become less competitive, and business dynamism has declined.
Investment also has been weak in most major economies. The persistent weakness of investment despite historically low interest rates has prompted concerns about the risk of “secular stagnation.” Weak productivity growth and investment have reinforced each other and are linked by similar shifts in market structures and dynamics.

Can policy reforms reverse the slowing of potential growth?

Shifts in labor markets
Technology is having profound effects on labor markets. Automation and digital advances are shifting labor demand away from routine low- to middle-level skills to higher-level and more sophisticated analytical, technical, and managerial skills. On the supply side, however, equipping workers with skills that complement the new technologies has lagged, hindering the broader diffusion of innovation within economies. Education and training have been losing the race with technology.
Most major economies face the challenge of aging populations. Many of them are also seeing a leveling off of gains in labor force participation rates and basic education attainments of the population. These trends put an even greater focus on productivity—and technological innovations that drive it—to deliver economic growth.
Rising inequality
Growth has also become less inclusive. Income inequality has been rising in most major economies, and the increase has been particularly pronounced in some of them, such as the United States. The new technologies favoring capital and higher-level skills have contributed to a decline in labor’s share of income and to increased wage inequality. They have also been associated with more concentrated industry structures and high economic rents enjoyed by dominant firms. Income has shifted from labor to capital and the distribution of both labor and capital income has become more unequal.
Rising inequality and mounting anxiety about jobs have contributed to increased social tensions and political divisiveness. Populism has surged in many countries. Nationalist and protectionist sentiment has been on the rise, with a backlash against international trade that, alongside technological change, is seen to have increased inequality with job losses and wage stagnation for low-skilled workers.
Changing growth pathways
While income inequality has been rising within many countries, inequality between countries has been falling as faster-growing emerging economies narrow the income gap with advanced economies. Technology poses new challenges for this economic convergence. Manufacturing-led growth in emerging economies has been the dominant driver of convergence, fueled by their comparative advantage in labor-intensive production based on their large pools of low-skill, low-wage workers. Such comparative advantage is eroding with automation of low-skill work, creating the need to develop alternative pathways to growth aligned with technological change.
AI, robotics, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution
Technological change reshaping growth will only intensify as artificial intelligence, advanced robotics, and cyber-physical systems take the digital revolution to another level. We may be on the cusp of what has been termed the “Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).” And globalization is going increasingly digital, a transformation that, analogous to 4IR, has been termed “Globalization 4.0.”

Technological change recently has not delivered its full potential in boosting productivity and economic growth. It has pushed income inequality higher and generated fears about a “robocalypse”—massive job losses from automation. This should not cause despair, however.
Advances in digital technologies hold considerable potential to lift the trajectory of productivity and economic growth, and to create new and better jobs to replace old ones. As much as two-thirds of potential productivity growth in major economies over the next decade could be related to the new digital technologies. But technological change is inherently disruptive and entails difficult transitions. It also inevitably creates winners and losers—as does globalization. Policies have a crucial role to play. Unfortunately, they have been slow to adapt to the challenges of change. With improved and more responsive policies, better outcomes are possible.
An agenda to harness the potential of new technology
The core of the forward policy agenda is to better harness the potential of the new technologies. Reforms must seek to improve the enabling environment for firms and workers—to broaden access to opportunities that come from technological change and to enhance capabilities to adjust to the new challenges.

Policies and institutions governing markets must keep pace as technological change transforms the world of business. Competition policies should be revamped for the digital age to ensure that markets continue to provide an open and level playing field for firms, keep competition strong, and check the growth of monopolistic structures. New regulatory issues revolving around data, the lifeblood of the digital economy, must be addressed. Flexibility in markets will be key to facilitating adjustments to disruptions and structural shifts from digital transformation.
The innovation ecosystem should keep pushing the technological frontier but also foster wider economic impacts from the new advances. With the intangible asset of knowledge becoming an increasingly important driver of economic success, research and development systems and patent regimes should be improved to promote broader diffusion of technologies embodying new knowledge.
The foundation of digital infrastructure and digital literacy must be strengthened. The digital divide is narrowing but wide gaps remain.
Investment in education and training must be boosted and reoriented to emphasize the skills for the jobs of the future. With the old career path of “learn-work-retire” giving way to one of continuous learning, programs for worker upskilling and reskilling and lifelong learning must the scaled up. The key to winning the race with technology is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines.
Labor market policies should become more forward-looking, shifting the focus from seeking to protect existing jobs to improving workers’ ability to change jobs. Social protection systems, traditionally based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships, should be adapted to a more dynamic job market. Social contracts need to realign with the changing nature of work.
Tax systems should be reviewed in light of the new tax challenges of the digital economy, including the implications of the transformations occurring in business and work and the new income distribution dynamics. The potential tax reform agenda spans taxes on labor, capital, and wealth.

Reforms are needed at the international level as well, although the dominant part of the agenda to make technology—and globalization—work better and for all rests with policies at the national level. Not only must past gains in establishing a rules-based international trading system be shielded from protectionist headwinds, but new disciplines must be devised for the next phase of globalization led by digital flows to ensure open access and fair competition. Sensible policies on migration can complement national policies, such as pension reform and lifelong learning, in mitigating the effects of population aging.
The era of smart machines holds much promise. With smart policies, the future could be one of stronger and more inclusive growth.

We investigate the relationship between the presence of migrant inventors and the dynamics of innovation in the migrants’ receiving countries. We find that countries are 25 to 60 percent more likely to gain advantage in patenting in certain technologies given a twofold increase in the number of foreign inventors from other nations that specialize in those same technologies. For the average country in our sample, this number corresponds to only 25 inventors and a standard deviation of 135. We deal with endogeneity concerns by using historical migration networks to instrument for stocks of migrant inventors. Our results generalize the evidence of previous studies that show how migrant inventors “import” knowledge from their home countries, which translates into higher patenting. We interpret these results as tangible evidence of migrants facilitating the technology-specific diffusion of knowledge across nations.

The Problem
Despite progress made over the past decade, further innovation is necessary to achieve deep decarbonization of the U.S. economy. Meeting climate policy goals currently under consideration will not be possible without further technological improvement. It will take several steps—from basic and applied research to demonstration and commercialization—to bring about technological change at the scale required to meet our goals for greenhouse gas reduction. Unfortunately, market failures affect all stages of clean energy technology development, meaning that market forces alone will not lead to optimal allocation of resources.
The Proposal
Popp explains how to use various policy instruments that have different effects depending on the type of technology, the stage of development, and the sector of the economy. Since separate policy instruments address different market failures, supporting clean energy innovation requires a portfolio of policy tools that will (1) increase the potential market for innovation (the demand side) and (2) address market failures that hinder innovation (the supply side).

Why did hundreds of Democratic strongholds break for Donald Trump in 2016 and stay loyal to him in 2020?
Looking for answers, Muravchik and Shields lived in three such “flipped” communities. There they discovered a political culture that was Trumpy long before the 45th president arrived on the national political scene.
In these places, dominated by the white working-class, some of the most beloved and longest-serving Democratic leaders are themselves Trumpian—grandiose, combative, thin-skinned, and nepotistic. Indifferent to ideology, they promise to take care of “their people” by cutting deals—and corners if needed. Stressing loyalty, they often turn to family to fill critical political roles. Trump, resembling these old-style Democratic bosses, strikes a familiar and appealing figure in these communities.
Although voters in “flipped” communities have often been portrayed as white supremacists, Muravchik and Shields find that their primary political allegiances are to place—not race. They will spend an extra dollar to patronize local businesses, and they think local jobs should go to their neighbors, not “foreigners” from neighboring counties—who are just as likely to be white and native-born. Unlike the Proud Boys, they take more pride in their local communities than in their skin color. Trump successfully courted these Democrats by promising to revitalize their struggling hometowns.
Because these communities largely stuck with Trump in 2020, Biden won the presidency by just the thinnest of margins. Whether they will continue to support a Republican Party without Trump—or swing back to the Democrats—depends in part on which party can satisfy these locally grown political tastes and values. The party that does that will enjoy a stranglehold in national elections for years to come.

Before U.S. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw his country from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018, Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister and the nuclear agreement’s chief Iranian architect, was the most popular public figure in his country. A year after the withdrawal, a University of Maryland poll shows, Zarif’s popularity was far surpassed by that of General Qassem Suleimani, the hardline Revolutionary Guard commander who was just assassinated in Baghdad on Trump’s order.

Trump says he authorized the drone strike that killed Suleimani to “stop a war.” It is far more likely that he has started one—or at least the march toward one.
No leader can be expected to anticipate precisely the effects of their foreign-policy decisions. But their expectations should be realistic, which means that they should be based on credible intelligence and a comprehensive understanding of the economic, political, historical, and cultural dynamics at work. When expectations are not realistic, the results are often disastrous.
This was the case with U.S. President George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, which, among other things, resulted in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths. And it has been so with virtually all of Trump’s foreign-policy decisions, particularly with regard to Iran.
Trump’s first major mistake was withdrawing from the JCPOA. Iran had not violated the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, and the other signatories remained committed to it as well. But Trump wanted more concessions from Iran’s leaders, so he disregarded his country’s commitments, re-imposed sanctions, and pushed U.S. partners and allies to follow his lead.
A “maximum pressure” campaign was supposed to lead either to Iran’s quick capitulation to exorbitant U.S. demands, as spelled out by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or to economic collapse. In the latter case, Trump’s hawkish advisers assured him, the restless and poverty-stricken Iranian public would reject hardliners like Suleimani and support the rise of a new leadership cadre that would bring peace and stability to the region. In 2018, John Bolton, then Trump’s national security adviser (who had previously advocated bombing Iran into submission), told a group of Iranian exiles that they would be celebrating regime change “before 2019.”

Iran: The double jeopardy of sanctions and COVID-19

Djavad Salehi-Isfahani
Wednesday, September 23, 2020






So confident was the Trump administration in its assessment that it seems never to have considered an alternative outcome. For example, it did not account for the possibility that Iran would respond to plummeting oil exports by increasing production. True, this is not the most obvious response, because it could dilute Iran’s remaining export revenues. But Iranians need oil, too, and could not afford the skyrocketing prices of comparable imports; in November, protests against rising gas prices swept the country.
The Trump administration surely did not anticipate that two years after the resumption of sanctions, Iran’s economy would be showing signs of recovery. And yet, during the third quarter of 2019, employment rose by 3.3 percent year on year, and unemployment declined to a seven-year low.
Clearly, the Trump administration badly misjudged Iran. But false beliefs about the country’s circumstances extend far beyond the White House. A 2018 New York Times op-ed exemplifies the low standard of evidence for reports depicting Iran’s economic and political fragility.

The commentary claimed that, according to “official sources,” 40 percent of Iranians lived below the poverty line in 2015. But the source to which that claim was hyperlinked led to an obscure Persian-language website that made no mention of any official report. Meanwhile, World Bank data show that the internationally comparable poverty rate in Iran for 2015 was 11 percent, around the same as in neighboring Turkey.
To be sure, when that article was published, Iranians were protesting economic hardship. But protest does not equal revolution, let alone successful regime change, especially in a country with security forces willing and able to use extreme brutality to crush dissent, as they did to halt November’s gas-price protests.
Yet observers should beware of the assumption that Iran’s hardliners are holding onto power by sheer force. The University of Maryland poll showed widespread support not only for Suleimani, but also for another hardliner: Ebrahim Raisi, who heads Iran’s judiciary.
This is not difficult to understand. In the 2013 and 2017 elections, Iranians threw their support behind the moderate Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani, because they believed that a nuclear agreement would usher in a new era of peace and economic security. But even though those leaders managed to deliver the JCPOA, they were powerless to stop the US from reneging on it.
Iranians wanted stability and prosperity. Instead, they got more economic hardship and unpredictability, including U.S. calls for regime change. Given how poorly U.S.-sponsored regime change has gone for other countries in their neighborhood, many embraced Suleimani, who had successfully defended Iran’s borders against Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, and, more recently, against the Islamic State.
George Orwell famously warned that a false belief ultimately “bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.” Unfortunately, that seems increasingly likely to happen to the U.S. in Iran—and soon.
"
232,https://www.brookings.edu/research/bowling-with-trump/,Bowling with Trump,"
Why did Donald Trump win the 2016 Presidential Election? Numerous reasons were canvassed in the aftermath of the result. Among them were the emergent power of social media and fake news (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017), Russian interference (Hall Jamieson 2018), the gap between low and high educated whites (Schaffner et al. 2017), lavish media attention on Trump (Sides et al. 2018), anti-incumbency (ibid.), economic anxiety (Autor et al. 2016), sexism (Valentino et al. 2019), and racism (Hooghe and Dassonneville 2018). In a prominent recent review of the literature and the evidence, Sides et al. (ibid.) acknowledge some role for all these factors but argue that the key force behind Trump’s victory was “racialized economics” and Trump’s willingness and ability to leverage it. Racialized economics is the tendency among some voters to consider economic issues not through an individual lens but through a racial one instead. As Sides et al. (2018, p. 8) explain:
The important sentiment underlying Trump’s support was not “I might lose my job” but, in essence, “people in my group are losing jobs to that other group”. Instead of pure economic anxiety, what mattered was racialized economics.
We quantitatively analyze this hypothesis using a very large dataset—the Gallup Daily Poll—and explicate the psychological roots of racialized economics. We argue that there is a channel from economic shocks to nativist voting via psychological wellbeing. Self-determination theory (SDT, Ryan and Deci 2017), a school of clinical psychology, argues that psychological well-being is a function of three basic psychological needs: for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these are thwarted, people will try to compensate. As economic decline in America is substantially a function of exogenous forces of globalization and technological change, there is little individuals can do to bolster their feelings of autonomy and competence. They may therefore focus on relatedness. One way to bolster their feelings of relatedness is by affiliating with salient identity groups such as race and nation. Similarly, theories of so-called “worldview defense” (WDT) argue that when people feel worried they will double-down on their in-group affiliations (Holbrook et al. 2011). In laboratory studies these typically overlap with broad identity markers like race and nation. Both literatures imply that economic decline, through its pernicious effect on psychological wellbeing, could encourage in-group bias. We argue that Trump, with his “America First” and “Build a Wall” policies and his nativist rhetoric, fueled and harnessed these sentiments to secure the Presidency.

Honing our hypothesis, a key inference of SDT and WDT is that in-group bias is more likely to manifest as identification with a broad group like race or nation when more intimate sources of group identification, like a church group or sports club, are unavailable. Sociologists have long noted that small, local sources of in-group identity, like bowling leagues and trade unions, have declined precipitously across America in recent decades (Putnam 2000, 2015). Religious affiliation and church attendance are similarly in free-fall (Pew Research Centre 2019). In line with the inferences of SDT and WDT, qualitative studies of Trump voters have tied this cultural decay to his success (Cramer 2016). A central thesis of Carney’s (2019) Alienated America is that Trump had greater cut through in areas with low levels of social capital and weak social institutions. Similarly, in her study of Tea Party supporters in Louisiana, Hochschild (2016, p. 225) writes that Trump’s “supporters have been in mourning for a lost way of life”. We therefore hypothesize that Trump should be successful in counties with high levels of worry and low levels of relatedness.

We test this hypothesis by combining rich individual-level well-being and socio-economic data from the Gallup Daily Poll with county-level data on economic indicators, racial animus, social capital, and election outcomes. We find that racial animus has a strong, positive association with Trump’s vote share independent from worry and relatedness. However, when we interact relatedness with racial animus, the coefficient on racial animus loses significance. Meanwhile, the interaction term is positively and significantly associated with Trump’s vote share. This suggests that people are using racial identification to bolster their sense of relatedness, in line with our hypothesis. In further support of our hypothesis, worry has a large and significant positive association with Trump’s performance, but an interaction between worry and relatedness is negative, substantially offsetting the independent positive effects of worry and relatedness. In other words, Trump had substantial cut through in worried counties except when they had existing sources of relatedness.

Many people are alarmed by the renewed salience of racial identification in American politics. After declining largely into electoral irrelevance over the second half of the twentieth century, race steadily returned as an electoral force in the 2000s. Indeed, according to Identity Crisis, a prominent recent accounting of the political science literature, “racialized economics” was the decisive factor in securing Donald Trump the Presidency in 2016. What explains this revival?

In a new background paper for the Brookings Institution, we argue that rising anxiety coupled with declining sources of social support, especially in left-behind parts of America, are at least partly responsible.
Self-Determination Theory (SDT), a body of literature from clinical and social psychology, argues that people have three basic psychological needs: for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomy is the feeling of being volitional and in charge of your life. Competence is a sense of skillfulness at tasks you need to flourish. And relatedness reflects security and fulfilment from one’s social connections.
Empirical work in SDT demonstrates that nourishing basic psychological needs promotes wellbeing in the form of vitality, positive mood, and life satisfaction, among other items. Similarly, thwarted needs promote illbeing in the form of depression, anxiety, and other psychopathologies.
Those whose needs are threatened or unmet will try to compensate. We speculate that negative economic shocks in the form of factory closures and cultural shocks in the form of declining status among whites, Christians, and men, have undermined autonomy and competence in rust belt communities.
The drivers of these shocks are mostly exogenous to the affected communities. Deindustrialization is a consequence of globalization and technological change. Status threat is partially a product of cultural changes and innovation in coastal, liberal, cosmopolitan regions.

Bowling with Trump

As they have little control over these threats to their autonomy and competence, voters in affected counties look to bolster relatedness instead. They rally around group identities and look for social support.
This is a common response to perceived threats observed in studies of so-called “worldview defense”. Social psychologists have noted that people induced through a variety of means into a state of anxiety display exaggerated loyalty to their in-groups, including race and nation, and disdain for outgroups.
People are more likely to identify with their racial in-group when other groups are not available in their community. Unfortunately, so-called social capital—a conception of community health—has declined precipitously across America since the 1970s. This is especially the case in the swing states of the rust belt that were instrumental to Trump’s success.
Trump spoke to the anxieties of these electorates with his anti-globalization message and the nostalgia of his slogan: “Make America Great Again”. He activated and leveraged the need for relatedness and worldview defense among these voters with his racial and nationalistic rhetoric and policies, notably “build a wall”.
In our empirical analysis using a large, representative sample of Americans from the Gallup Daily Poll, we found that Trump was more successful in counties with relatively high rates of anxiety and relatively low levels of relatedness. Where community is strong, people don’t need racial identification to feel secure.
Perhaps more importantly, we found that racial animus on its own, measured using the intensity of Google searches for the N-word, was positively associated with Trump’s vote share. But this association lost significance and was replaced by relatedness once we introduced it into the model. It seems that rising racial animus is not so much about prejudice. It is about racial identification and solidarity to feel part of a group for social support (though prejudice may be a second-order effect).
Importantly and curiously, we found a strong, positive association between social capital and Trump’s vote share. We use the Joint Economic Committee’s definition of social capital, which items to capture community health using items like the ratio of NGOs to population in a county. Our result reflects cohesive rural and religious counties that typically vote Republican—it is a partisan effect. It suggests that racial animus did not play a role in these counties breaking Republican.
In an importance robustness check of our results, we replicated our analysis for the Republican party primaries in 2016. Only worry and relatedness where significantly associated with Trump’s performance in these primaries.  This suggests that social capital is associated with Republican party partisanship, but not Trump specifically.
One study should not be the basis for strong policy conclusions. However, we will cautiously make three points. First, while racial prejudice may follow from rising racial identification, it is a consequence, not a cause. The main drivers are fear and social disintegration. Anti-racism efforts aimed at formerly moderate whites should thus be directed at these psychological triggers, rather than racism itself.
Second, policymakers must become more sophisticated in their valuation of community. Sustaining community health against economic headwinds is often financially costly and raises complex normative issues. But the costs of following a crude economic (neo)liberalism approach arguably outweighs the benefits.
Finally, cultural actors like intellectuals, artists, and politicians urgently need to refresh shared identities that can reach across the many fissures in contemporary American life.

235,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/04/13/trumps-lies-corrode-democracy/,Trump’s lies corrode democracy,"
The recent disputes over President Trump’s language during bipartisan negotiations over the fate of DACA and his claims about the U.S. trade balance with Canada illustrate his tenuous relationship with the truth. But do Trump’s lies really matter? Are they different from other presidential lies? Previous research has demonstrated that most modern presidents have told lies for a variety of reasons, from legitimate lies concerning national security, to trivial misstatements, to shading the truth, to avoiding embarrassment, to serious lies of policy deception. However, when a president continues to insist that his previous false statements are true, the institutions of government become corroded and democracy is undermined.
Of course, many of Trump’s lies are “conventional” lies similar to those that politicians often tell in order to look good or avoid blame. But the number of these types of lies by Trump vastly exceeds the lies of previous presidents. Glen Kessler of the Washington Post compiled a list of more than 2000 misleading or false statements in Trump’s first 355 days in office. Leonhardt, et al., of the New York Times, using a much more conservative definition of false statements, compiled 103 separate untruths during Trump’s first ten months in office. These lists often include flip-flops, self-contradictions, unwarranted credit taking, and exaggerations.
But aside from volume, Trump’s lies differed significantly from those of previous presidents.  Some of his most frequent lies are bragging about his achievements in ways that are demonstrably untrue and contrary to well-known and accepted facts. For example Trump claimed that he had his picture on the cover of Time Magazine more than any other person; that he signed more bills than any other president in his first six months in office; that the crowd at his inauguration was larger than Obama’s; that he had the largest number of electoral votes since Reagan. These lies undermine public confidence in President Trump and American government, increasing public cynicism. But these falsehoods, as bad as they are, are not as insidious as the repetition of false statements with important political and policy implications.
Whether consciously intended or not, Trump’s policy and political lies can have a significant impact on public opinion, particularly with those who are favorably disposed toward him. Systematic research in psychology and political science has demonstrated that once “misinformation” is initially encoded in a person’s mind, it is very difficult to change perceptions through credible corrections. In fact, attempted corrections often reinforce the initial misinformation.
For example, for several years, Trump continued to foster the “birther” lie that President Obama was a Muslim and not born in the United States, leading many voters to doubt Obama’s documented place of birth and thus the legitimacy of his presidency. In September 2016 Trump finally did admit that Obama was born in the United States, but he also falsely alleged that Hillary Clinton had started the birther lie. Trump claimed that he saw Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11, which encouraged in some of his followers an unfounded hostility toward Muslims. He said he would have won the popular vote in 2016 if millions of illegal aliens had not voted for Hillary Clinton, which undermines confidence in the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral system. He claimed that the U.S. unemployment rate was 42 percent, when it was actually around five percent. He claimed that the United States has the highest taxes in the world, leading many Americans to believe that the U.S. tax system is unfair. He claimed that President Obama had tapped the phones of Trump’s transition operation. In 2017, he asserted that the U.S. murder rate was the highest in 47 years when the national murder rate had been steadily falling since the 1990s.
When previous presidents have been caught making false statements, they have usually tried to equivocate or claim that they were technically not lying, as when President Clinton denied that he had sex with Monica Lewinsky, by saying “it depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” Hillary Clinton equivocated about whether she sent classified information through her personal email account. When questions were raised about the accuracy of President Obama’s assurances that after passage of Obamacare anyone who wanted could keep their present policy, he stopped making the claim.

Trump’s failed presidency

All of Trump’s lies that contradict commonly accepted facts challenge the fundamental principles of the Enlightenment, which are premised on the belief that there are objective facts discoverable through investigation, empirical evidence, rationality, and the scientific method. From these premises, it follows that political discourse involves making logical arguments and adducing evidence in support of those arguments, rather than asserting one’s own self-serving version of reality. Senator Patrick Moynihan’s admonition is apropos: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.”
Trump’s refusal to attempt to refute charges that he was telling falsehoods, admit their inaccuracy, or attempt to wiggle out of them by equivocating demonstrates either his lack of touch with reality or his conviction that he does not have to explain himself to others. Insistence on his false statements is an assertion of power. Lewis Carroll’s story, Through the Looking Glass, provides an insight about the relationship of words to power:
Humpty Dumpty: “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.”

Trump’s lies, large or small, often implicate others in his administration, such as when then-press secretary, Sean Spicer, argued that Trump’s inaugural crowd was larger than Obama’s. In defense of Spicer, Kellyanne Conway said that he was using “alternative facts.”
Trump also does not hesitate to provide presidential approval of others’ lies. On November 29, 2017, Trump retweeted a video posted by a British right wing nationalist group, entitled “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” Dutch authorities stated that the aggressive boy was neither a migrant nor a Muslim. In response to questions about the president seeming to endorse the non-verified video, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said “Whether it’s a real video, the threat is real. His goal is to promote strong border security and strong national security.” Hher comments implied that facts or reality do not matter as long as President Trump uses falsehoods to further his political goals.
Trump’s refusal to admit the truth of widely accepted facts corrodes political discourse and is consistent with the practice of many authoritarian leaders. The assertion of the power to define reality is destructive of democratic governance, in part because many people believe him and are not amenable to contrary evidence.
Even though his narcissistic lies are detrimental to the democratic process, Trump’s continued adherence to demonstrably false statements about politics and policy strikes at the very heart of democracy and the whole project of enlightenment epistemology. If there are no agreed upon facts, then it becomes impossible for people to make judgments about their government or hold it accountable.

Executive Summary
China has significantly expanded its engagements in the Indian Ocean region over the past three decades, raising fears among American and Indian strategists that its growing naval presence, together with its use of so-called “debt-trap diplomacy,” might provide it with meaningful military advantages far from its shores.

Although China’s ultimate aims in the Indian Ocean remain somewhat ambiguous, it is clear that the Chinese leadership is actively pursuing capabilities that would allow it to undertake a range of military missions in the region. This paper explores five such mission objectives — ranging from relatively “benign” activities to those that would be more alarming to U.S. and Indian policy planners — and describes the kinds of defense and economic investments that China would require to carry them out. These objectives are: 1) conduct non-combat activities focused on protecting Chinese citizens and investments, and bolstering China’s soft power influence; 2) undertake counterterrorism activities, unilaterally or with partners, against organizations that threaten China; 3) collect intelligence in support of operational requirements, and against key adversaries; 4) support efforts aimed at coercive diplomacy toward small countries in the region; and 5) enable effective operations in a conflict environment, namely the ability to deter, mitigate, or terminate a state-sponsored interdiction of trade bound for China, and to meaningfully hold at risk U.S. or Indian assets in the event of a wider conflict.
This paper argues, first, that while the United States, India, and their partners are right to be concerned that China is developing a range of dual-use capabilities that could prove valuable for higher-end missions in a conflict environment, policymakers should take care not to assume that, in the Indian Ocean context, China can easily leverage “debt-trap diplomacy” investments in ports and other infrastructure for meaningful military advantage. The kinds of capabilities that the Chinese military would want to leverage in a conflict would go beyond what might be available from a commercial venture or intermittent ship visits. Indeed, access arrangements that are grounded in economic coercion are unlikely to be politically stable or strategically reliable.
Second, this paper argues that notwithstanding some skepticism about the military utility of China’s commercial activities in the region to date, there are indeed investments that could foreshadow China’s intention and capability to be able to operate high-end military missions of the kind that would be perceived as threatening to U.S. and Indian interests. Policymakers should watch carefully for leading indicators that could presage Chinese efforts to undertake such missions. These include certain kinds of naval deployments that clearly overmatch the requirements of counterpiracy or humanitarian activities; new platforms for maritime-based intelligence collection against state adversaries; and efforts to bolster the resilience of logistics networks that would be critical to sustaining operations in a conflict environment.

257,https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/chinas-digital-currency-will-rise-but-not-rule/,China’s digital currency will rise but not rule,"
A few years ago, China’s currency seemed to be rising inexorably to global dominance. The renminbi had become the fifth most important currency for international payments, and in 2016, the International Monetary Fund included it in the basket of major currencies that determines the value of Special Drawing Rights (the IMF’s global reserve asset).	






Eswar Prasad
Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development

Since then, however, the renminbi’s progress has stalled. Its share of international payments has fallen below 2 percent, and the share of global foreign-exchange reserves held in renminbi-denominated assets seems to have plateaued at about 2 percent.
Earlier this year, China rolled out a central-bank digital currency, making it one of the first major economies to do so. Trials of the so-called Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) have started in four cities, and the government recently announced plans to expand the tests to major metropolises such as Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Hong Kong and Macau. But the DCEP on its own will not be a game changer that elevates the renminbi’s role in international finance.
True, China has leapfrogged the United States and other advanced economies in the technological sophistication of its retail payment systems. It seems plausible, therefore, that the digital renminbi will give China an edge in the competition for global financial-market dominance.
But the reality is more sobering. The DCEP will initially be usable only for payments within China, although this could change over time. For all the hype about the new digital currency, China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, introduced in 2015, is a more important innovation that makes it easier to use the renminbi for international transactions.
This payment system is also able to bypass the Western-dominated SWIFT system for international payments and thus circumvent U.S. financial sanctions, a tempting prospect for many governments. Russia—or, for that matter, Iran and Venezuela—will now find it easier to be paid in renminbi for their oil exports to China. As the renminbi becomes more widely used, other smaller and developing countries that have strong trade and financial links with China might start to invoice and settle their transactions directly in that currency. The DCEP could eventually be linked up to the cross-border payments system, further digitizing international payments.

Still, the DCEP by itself will make little difference to whether foreign investors regard the renminbi as a reserve currency. After all, the Chinese government still restricts capital inflows and outflows, and the People’s Bank of China still manages the renminbi’s exchange rate. Neither policy is likely to change significantly anytime soon.
Renminbi boosters will point out that the government has eased restrictions on capital flows and signaled its intention eventually to open the capital account fully, and that the PBOC has pledged to reduce its currency interventions and let market forces have their way. But whenever shifts in capital flows put significant pressure on the renminbi, the government invariably reverts to command-and-control mode and tightens capital controls and exchange-rate management. Foreign investors, including central banks, will therefore remain skeptical about the prospect of unfettered capital flows at market-driven exchange rates.
In any event, foreign and domestic investors are unlikely to view the renminbi as a safe-haven currency in times of global financial turmoil. That requires trust, which is fostered by adherence to the rule of law and well-established checks and balances in the political system.

Some argue that the rule of law does exist in China, and that the country’s non-democratic, one-party system of government contains enough self-correcting mechanisms to prevent policymakers from running amok. But these arrangements are not a credible or durable substitute for an institutionalized system of checks and balances such as that in the U.S., where the separation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches serves to constrain the exercise of power.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is doing all it can to weaken America’s institutions, undermine the rule of law, and erode the Federal Reserve’s independence. But in international finance, everything is relative. America’s economic dominance, deep and liquid capital markets, and still-robust institutional framework mean that the U.S. dollar still has no serious rival as the world’s leading reserve currency.
Any global gains the renminbi has made in recent years, both as a means of payment and as a reserve currency, have mostly come at the expense of currencies such as the euro and the British pound. Even when the IMF added the renminbi to the four existing currencies in the SDR basket and gave it a 10.9 percent weighting, it was mainly the euro, the pound, and the Japanese yen that gave way, not the dollar.
China’s new digital currency and its cross-border payments system will together enhance the renminbi’s role as an international payments currency if the government continues to reform the country’s financial markets and remove restrictions on capital flows. But they will hardly put a dent in the dollar’s status as the dominant global reserve currency.

258,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2019/02/04/chinas-changing-approach-to-africa/,China’s changing approach to Africa,"
The 2018 Beijing Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit was the signature event that determined China’s priorities toward Africa for the next three years. Deviating from its tradition of doubling or tripling its financial pledges, China’s commitment remained the same as in 2015, $60 billion. Judging from its volume and composition, China’s commitment remains strong, but appears to be more cautious and calculating than its past pledges. The concessionality of the Chinese financing is being moderated, while China has grown visibly more focused on the commercial and viability aspects. From the traditional model of “resources for infrastructure,” China appears to be morphing toward the next stage: equity investment by a more diverse group of investors supported by state development finance. Meanwhile, Africa still has major catching up to do to gain more Chinese investment and to diversify its trade relations with China.

The Chinese narrative about its development efforts toward Africa is undergoing significant changes. Indeed, China has demonstrated an increasing interest in identifying its financial contribution as development finance, rather than development assistance. First, this is because China has failed to meet the prevailing criteria for official development assistance. Second, the reduced emphasis on the aid aspects also helps to square the circle between the self-serving, commercial aspects of the Chinese financing and the presumably altruistic intention of China as a responsible stakeholder.
What China offers Africa is not a blank check and a guaranteed result.
Indeed, what China offers Africa is not a blank check and a guaranteed result. Instead, Beijing offers Africa the opportunity to speed up its economic development based on the infrastructure China develops, to utilize the technologies, employment, and market opportunities China creates, and to stimulate the desire and competition for growth through market-based rather than assistance-based approach. The Chinese financing is neither free nor altruistic. But that is not the point. The real point is: How can Africa better utilize the opportunities China creates and avoid the traps it brings? The answer to that question has not been China’s priority, but instead it has focused on better decisionmaking, more disciplined domestic policy, and, most importantly, better governance.
As China expands its Belt and Road Initiative in Africa, government-level U.S.-China cooperation in Africa continues to be scarce. However, this trend contrasts sharply with the growing collaboration between Chinese and American companies in infrastructure projects on the continent. Indeed, although the Chinese projects and financing have the tradition of favoring Chinese contractors and providers, the technical advantages of some American companies have made them the beneficiary of the Chinese campaign.

China’s buildup of debt to fuel economic growth has raised fears of an eventual collapse. So, what factors would precipitate such a collapse? And if one were to occur, how would it affect the rest of the world? How can Chinese policymakers guard against financial crisis? These are questions that Bloomberg Economics Chief Economist Tom Orlik takes up in his new book, China: The Bubble That Never Pops. Orlik joins David Dollar in this episode to discuss China’s economic growth model, the potential for reforms, and how the economy has responded to the trade war and COVID-19.

Dollar: Hi, I’m David Dollar, host of the Brookings trade podcast “Dollars and Sense.” Today, my guest is Tom Orlik, chief economist of Bloomberg Economics and the author of the new book, “China: The Bubble that Never Pops.” So welcome to the show, Tom.  
Orlik: Great to be here, David. Thanks for having me on. 
Dollar: So, you lived in Beijing for a long time. I think 10 years, if I remember correctly. And you’ve seen both the best and the worst of China. Let’s start with the positive. What are some of the things you saw that help us understand how China has been successful and dynamic?  
Orlik: So, I think one of the prevailing narratives about China that we hear in the West is that because of the single–party state and because of the large presence of the state in the economy, the policy space and the market space is both kind of sclerotic. Right? There’s just been a kind of nationwide suppression of incentives to perform – something like we saw in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. And I think that’s sort of an important underpinning of the China collapse pessimism or China collapse theories that implicitly inform U.S. views on China.  
It’s certainly true that the political system and the state ownership in the economy have a depressing impact, but my overwhelming impression from meeting with Chinese policymakers, Chinese workers, and Chinese entrepreneurs was a sense of dynamism, forward-looking optimism, and ingenuity. So, if we just think about the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, I think one of the things which strikes me about the People’s Bank of China over the last fifteen years is just how much policy innovation there has been there. From the reform of the interest rate system, to the reform of the exchange rate system, to the steps which they’ve taken to begin de-risking the financial system. It just strikes me as a kind of very energetic and ingenious institution.  
Clearly there’s a huge number of problems in China. Clearly there are a huge number of problems with the social system. But if we focus narrowly on the economics, the impression I came away with from discussions with policymakers, discussions on the ground, was that sense that people were motivated and did have an incentive to think outside the box.  
Dollar: That’s a really nice point, Tom, about policy space. My experience in China as well was that there really was a lot of room for debate on certain topics. A lot of the issues you take up about the financial sector and debt and the growth model, you know, these things are actively debated. Other topics are completely taboo and I’m certainly not defending Chinese authoritarianism, but nice point about a lot of freedom – freedom may be too generous a word – but a lot of space for policy debate.  
So let’s turn to your book. A key point of it is that China has relied a lot on the build-up of debt, that is rapid growth of credit in order to fuel growth. So, how would you summarize the basic story of your book? Why do they need this rapid credit growth? Who’s doing the borrowing? Who’s doing the lending?  
Orlik: So the original sin of China’s economy and China’s unbalanced growth model is an extremely high savings rate. China saves a very, very high proportion of its national income. And to turn that saving into demand, there’s two possibilities. They can lend it overseas and then it comes back to the Chinese economy in the form of export demand. And that’s what they did very successfully in the 1990s and even more after they entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. Or, they can lend it to themselves, and then it comes back in the form of investment. After the great financial crisis, exporting wasn’t really working anymore, so the model switched from turning saving into exports to turning saving into investment. And so from 2008 on, we had just an astonishingly rapid buildup of debt in the financial system.  
In 2008 extending borrowing was up by 140% of GDP. By the time you get to 2015, it’s gone all the way up to 250% of GDP. And when we look around the world, we can’t actually find any other economies which have taken on so much debt in such a short period of time. But we do find a bunch of economies like Korea in 1997, the U.S. ahead of the Lehman shock in 2008, Greece and other countries ahead of the European sovereign debt crisis, which took on a lot of debt – not as much debt as China, but a lot of debt – and they had a financial crisis. So the concern people have looking into China is: you’ve borrowed so much, you borrowed so much in such a short period of time, surely you’re going to have a bunch of bad loans. Surely your banks are going to fall over.  
Dollar: So given that buildup in debt, obviously there’s a risk of a financial crisis. That‘s a key point of your book. You don’t see that as the most likely scenario – we can come back to that – but it’s certainly a possibility. What might be some of the precipitating events? There’s the coronavirus, the trade war with the U.S., or something that I haven’t thought of yet – are these possible precipitating events for a financial crisis?  
Orlik: That’s a great question. When we think about a financial crisis, you need two conditions to be met to have a financial crisis. You need a bunch of bad loans and you need the funding for the banks to dry up. So if you think about the Lehman shock, for example, both of these things happened. Right? Lehman had a bunch of investments in mortgage-backed securities which turned out to be much riskier than Lehman had realized. Then when the investors which were funding Lehman’s operations realized that Lehman had these very risky positions, they pulled away their funding and Lehman collapsed. So you need both of these things to be in place. You need the bad loans, but you also need the funding for the banks to disappear.  
So this is kind of a useful framework for thinking about what could trigger a crisis in China. And you already have one of the conditions. Right? There’s already a lot of bad loans in China. If we look at the balance sheets of the city banks then we see a very large buildup of sort of shadowy investments; probably money which has already been lent to borrowers that can’t service their loans. So there’s a lot of bad loans there, and problems like the COVID shock, problems like a renewed trade war with the U.S. if that’s what we get, would make that worse. Right? Because problems like that, they hammer incomes for borrowers. They make it harder for them to service their debt, and so they mean we’re more likely to have bad loans.  
The other condition for a financial crisis, the disappearance of funding, or the drying up of funding for the banks, that’s the condition which is not met in China. And one of the big arguments in my book is that because the savings rate is very high, and because it’s still difficult to take money out of the country, banks have a very solid funding base. And that’s why, even as we see hidden bad loans increase, we don’t see China’s banks falling over.  
Dollar: Right. So I basically agree with you there, Tom. One thing I worry about – a key part of all this is that China has pretty effective capital controls. So there’s real limitations on how much people can take out of the country and they seemed to work pretty well. But I assume whether capital controls work or not depends a lot on the state of the world. And if Chinese people really lose confidence in their system then there are probably a lot of ways around the capital controls that haven’t been discovered yet. And I don’t see that happening at the moment, but to me that’s a fundamental issue. You know, are people losing faith in the Chinese system. 
Orlik: Yeah, I think you’re completely right. I was in Beijing in 2015–2016 at that moment where we had a collapse in the Chinese equity market and that botched devaluation of the yuan by the People’s Bank of China which triggered that sort of panicked moment when hundreds of billions of dollars left China very quickly. And that was a moment where, I think, there was a genuine sense of panic and a genuine fear that perhaps the risks could crystallize because, of course, if you have enormous capital outflows, then you do have the funding for the banks disappearing, and that is a moment when a financial crisis could happen. But what Beijing did in that moment was quietly tighten the screws.  
I remember going to the bank at that period to try and transfer some of my earnings into dollars and move them out of the country. And the paper trail…no one said no, but the paper trail that was required was kind of a mile long. At one point my bank said your employment contract is not long enough. So, yes, ultimately if Chinese people lose faith in the Chinese economy and we see mass capital flight, that is not something the Chinese government is going to be able to easily control, especially because the trade account is so big and there’s so many ways of hiding capital flows in the trade account. But what we saw in 2015–2016 was that they are actually quite good at tightening the screws when they want to.  
Dollar: So if the bubble in China does pop and there’s a financial crisis, can you sketch out what it might look like? How it affects China and how it would affect the U.S. and the rest of the world?  
Orlik: So you have a shock to China and that shock ripples out and hits the rest of the world. So what happens in China? Well, it starts with a default for a single borrower. Banks recalculate the risks associated with lending to similar borrowers. They start pulling back lending. They start refusing to roll over loans. Defaults spread, and what starts as a kind of a single default spreads out to be a systemic crisis. Businesses which rely on credit – which of course is all businesses – and don’t have enough cash flow to keep themselves solvent start going bankrupt. They start letting go of workers, demand disappears, and you have a kind of a self-feeding shock similar to what we saw in the United States after the Lehman shock in 2008. So China’s growth, which let’s say after the COVID shock goes back to 4-5 percent a year, craters, and you have a period of contraction in China’s economy.  
Now, when the U.S. financial system blew up in 2008–2009, it was the financial linkages which spilled around the world and caused problems for European banks and Japanese banks and Latin American banks. And then, of course, the collapse in U.S. demand had a second round effect. So all of these countries had a financial shock and then they had a real economy shock because demand for imports from the U.S. disappeared.  
In China, as you know, David, financial linkages with the rest of the world are just not that well developed. There aren’t a lot of businesses around the world, or a lot of banks around the world, that have very close or very important connections with the Chinese banks. So if China’s financial system implodes, then we don’t actually see that immediate financial ripple effect. What we would see is a kind of a risk–off mood, a risk–off moment for global financial markets. So you’d expect to see equity markets in the U.S. and Europe and Japan collapse; potentially with significant negative confidence effects which would hit those economies immediately. And then – this is the bigger one – you see a real economy impact.  
China’s a very significant driver of demand for exports, especially for commodity producers like Australia or Brazil or Chile. So they suffer substantially. China is also now a very substantial driver of demand for other countries in the Asia region. So Chinese tourists disappear, Chinese consumer demand falls, and countries in the region, like Thailand, for example, see their grade fall very sharply. Asian countries are also extremely integrated into the Chinese electronics supply chain. So if we see a financial crisis which hits the Chinese manufacturing sector, and we see the big electronics producers on the East Coast go bankrupt, then that also has a negative impact on Japan and Korea and the Philippines and other countries that feed into that electronics supply chain.  
What does it do to Europe and the U.S.? Well, actually, the impact there is a bit less, and there are some countervailing positives. So the impact is a bit less because those countries are much further away. And, yes, they export to China, but not as much as a commodity producer or an Asian neighbor. And most of these countries are commodity importers. So, if China collapses, and the price of oil, for example, collapses, that’s actually good news for some European countries because it means their import bill falls.

Order from Chaos
The COVID-19 recession is a good time to accelerate Chinese reform

David Dollar, Yiping Huang, and Yang Yao
Tuesday, July 7, 2020





Dollar: Let’s talk a little bit about the response to the coronavirus. The natural response we’re seeing all around the world is big Keynesian stimulus through fiscal policy, monetary. The numbers in Japan and the United States are overwhelming; as much as 20 percent of GDP in the case of Japan.  
I find it interesting that China actually seems rather modest in terms of the stimulus it’s rolling out. China lacks transparency on some of this, but to the best we can estimate, it is providing fiscal and monetary stimulus but far less than the United States or Japan. So does this mean the technocrats, or the top leaders behind them, are they getting serious about controlling leverage? Is this a response to the kind of worries that are raised in your book?  
Orlik: I think that’s a really interesting question, David. I think there’s a few things going on. The first thing is that they really overdid it in 2008. That famous four–trillion yuan stimulus, which Premier Wen launched, was very effective at offsetting the impact of the great financial crisis, but the stimulus went on for too long and it’s left China with this legacy of a huge amount of debt. So they just don’t have space to run another very big stimulus.  
I think the second thing is that China has some instruments which other countries do not have. So the state sector in China is very big and very inefficient and a big source of corruption. And that’s probably a net negative for China, but it’s also an instrument which the government can use to act as a kind of countercyclical buffer. So the private sector isn’t hiring, the private sector isn’t investing, but the government can instruct the state sector to keep hold of their employees and to accelerate investment projects. I think maybe this is what you were hinting at with your point about transparency. It’s not fiscal stimulus; it’s kind of a quasi-fiscal stimulus so it doesn’t show up on the Ministry of Finance’s books, but it has a similar type of impact on the economy.  
Dollar: So ultimately you’re cautiously optimistic, I would say, in that you don’t see the financial crisis as the most likely scenario. But you highlight some serious risks. What are the most important things for China to do to continue healthy growth without a financial crisis? You’ve touched on some of them, but what would you add in terms of the policy agenda for China?  
Orlik: So to continue growing China needs to engineer a set of mutually reinforcing reforms. They need to restore the link between credit growth and growth in the real economy so that they can grow without massively adding to the existing levels of debt and leverage. They need to continue a transition from manufacturing to services. They need a smaller and more efficient state sector, leaving more room for a dynamic private sector. That’s one area where they’re certainly not making progress and indeed going in the wrong direction in the last few years. And they need a larger role for consumption, a smaller role for investment. And they need to have a more environmentally sustainable growth model. 
So that sounds like a lot – it is a lot. But in fact, all of these transitions are mutually reinforcing. Right? So the service sector is more capital-light than the industrial sector. The service sector is more carbon-light than the industrial sector. And the service sector is more labor intensive than the industrial sector. So, as you transition from industry to services, you don’t need so much credit, so the relationship between credit growth and the rate economy gets better. You don’t burn so much carbon, so your economy becomes more environmentally sustainable. And you employ more people, so labor demand goes up, wages rise more quickly, and hopefully you get stronger consumption.  
There’s a huge amount to do. In some respects, China’s moving in the wrong direction, especially on the relationship between the state and the private sector, but many of these transitions are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, so I think that’s a sort of a basis for cautious optimism.  
Dollar: I see a common thread running through a lot of those recommendations is the need to open up and create more competitive markets in different areas. And the natural response to the coronavirus might be to close things off. We’re seeing that around the world, which I think is quite unfortunate. So it takes a quite a bit of leadership and even courage to go in the other direction. I mean, on a positive note, you probably noticed that China reached an agreement with ASEAN and Japan and South Korea on the RCEP trade agreement, which is modest, but still it’s a positive step in the right direction that will force China to open up its markets a little bit more.  
Orlik: Years ago I decided to myself that I could only absorb a certain number of acronyms, and the RCEP trade agreement didn’t make the cut. So, I didn’t track developments there, but it certainly sounds like it sounds like a positive one.  
Dollar: Right, it’s the Regional Comprehensive Economic Program, and for a long time we economists kind of pooh-poohed that it’s not nearly as deep integration as in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but it’s pretty serious trade liberalization. Curiously enough, its positive effects in some sense are quantitatively about the same as the negative effects of the U.S. trade war. So you could say that China is undoing the trade war by participating in this Asia Pacific-wide trade liberalization. 
In fact, that brings me nicely to the last topic I want to take up, Tom. Not so directly relevant to your book, but obviously in everyone’s mind: U.S.-China relations. It’s related in the sense that hostility or the trade war from the U.S. has to make China’s growth a little bit more difficult and raise the risks of some kind of financial crisis. You’ve been covering U.S.-China relations for a long time. Do you see much prospect for an improvement? Do you think things are going to get worse? How do you read U.S.-China economic relations?  
Orlik: I think the question is, is Donald Trump going to turn out to be an aberration in terms of his approach to U.S.-China relations, or is he going to turn out to be a kind of turning point? Of course, that question might not be important. We’ve got an election in November. It’s possible that President Trump will win, and so if that happens I would anticipate we’d have something that looks like continuity in U.S.-China relations. If Biden wins, then we’ll find out. Has Trump identified the new trajectory for U.S.-China relations and is that going to be the trajectory going forwards, or was he a moment and actually we’re going to go back to more constructive engagement? I suspect that actually it’s the former.  
I think that fear of China’s rise is not something which is unique to President Trump. I think it is fairly widespread among U.S. voters. And indeed, I think it’s sort of a growing feeling in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere as well. I think we’re at the beginning of a global shift where businesses and governments view China less through the lens of an opportunity to be tapped and more through the lens of a risk, or even a threat, that has to be managed.  
That’s going to be a problem for China. It’s going to be a problem because it’s going to restrict global export markets for Chinese goods and Chinese services. A bigger problem for China, I think, is that China is still playing catch-up on technology, and the quickest way to catch up is to learn from overseas – or if we’re being less charitable, to steal from overseas. And that was a process which worked very nicely for China up until quite recently. There were basically no constraints on multinationals setting up shop. There were limited constraints global research partnerships. There was limited pushback even on intellectual property theft. And now that door to technology transfer is creaking closed, and I think that’s going to be a long–term and potentially rather serious drag on China’s capacity to develop and to drive productivity growth.  
Dollar: I’m David Dollar, and I’ve been talking to Tom Orlik about his new book “China: The Bubble That Never Pops.” It’s a really enjoyable read that you can buy from all the usual places. It gets into some really complicated issues about China’s growth model, financial sector, risk of financial crisis, but explains it in a very non-technical and enjoyable fashion. So, thank you very much for joining us, Tom.  
Orlik: Thanks very much, David. I felt when I was writing the book that I was very much indebted to the powerful analysis and insights of a whole group of China analysts. Over the years, I learned a huge amount from reading your work and occasional opportunities to speak with you. So, thank you very much.

Executive summary
As the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to become a “world-class military,” its progress in advanced weapons systems continues to provoke intense concern from its neighbors and competitors. The Chinese military and China’s defense industry have been pursuing significant investments in robotics, swarming, and other applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Thus far, advances in weapons systems described or advertised as “autonomous” (自主) or “intelligentized” (智能化) have built upon existing strengths in the research and development of unmanned (无人) systems and missile technology. While difficult to evaluate the sophistication of these emerging capabilities, this initial analysis concentrates on indicators of progress in weapons systems that may possess a range of levels of autonomy.

This paper reviews advances in the Chinese military and defense industry to date, evaluates the potential implications of Chinese approaches to arms control and governance, assesses potential future developments, and then considers the strategic implications, as well as policy options for the United States and likeminded democracies. Based on publicly available information, the PLA’s trajectory in the development and potential employment of AI/ML-enabled and autonomous weapons systems remains uncertain. The maturity of these capabilities — as well as if, when, and to what extent weapons systems with greater levels of autonomy have been fielded — cannot be assessed with high confidence at this point. However, as technological competition emerges as an ever more prominent element of great power rivalry, it is clear the Chinese military and defense industry have undertaken active initiatives in research, development, and experimentation. Yet China’s progress will remain contingent upon the capacity to operationalize emerging weapons systems, which will require overcoming current technological and organizational challenges in testing, training, and concepts of operations.
Chinese advances in autonomy and AI-enabled weapons systems could impact the military balance, while potentially exacerbating threats to global security and strategic stability as great power rivalry intensifies. In striving to achieve a technological advantage, the Chinese military could rush to deploy weapons systems that are unsafe, untested, or unreliable under actual operational conditions. The PLA’s strategic choices about which capabilities could prove advantageous will influence the direction of Chinese military innovation. It is encouraging that Chinese military scientists and researchers are starting to debate and engage with safety issues and technical concerns, as well as legal and ethical considerations. Nonetheless, People’s Republic of China (PRC) arms sales to potential adversaries to the United States, and to militaries with little regard for the law of war, threaten U.S. values and interests, while accelerating the proliferation of these capabilities to non-state actors. Going forward, the United States should monitor these trends and pursue measures to mitigate such risks.

262,https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/chinas-central-government-seeks-to-rein-in-regulatory-documents/,China’s central government seeks to rein in regulatory documents,"
As the Trump administration seeks to pare back agency regulations, the Xi administration in China is clamping down on guidance-type regulatory documents, frequently called “red-headed” documents due to the official letterhead on which they are issued. 	






Jamie P. Horsley
Visiting Fellow - Foreign Policy, John L. Thornton China Center





The U.S. business community in China has long complained about these directives, conservatively estimated to number in the millions, and their inconsistent enforcement. Even though red-headed documents frequently impact the public’s rights and obligations, they have not been required to go through the increasingly transparent rulemaking procedures that apply to legally binding regulations and rules adopted at all levels of the Chinese government.
In May 2018, the Chinese State Council imposed a detailed set of requirements—the “Circular”—to govern the content and management of regulatory documents. In December 2018, the State Council mandated that agencies assess such documents’ legality prior to adoption. Moreover, the public may now ask Chinese courts to review the legality, under China’s Administrative Litigation Law, of regulatory documents that were the basis for a contested government action.
Regulatory documents are a category of what are called “normative documents” (guifanxing wenjian). These include, when used in the term’s broad sense, both legislative documents and non-legislative documents. Legislative documents consist of laws adopted by the National People’s Congress or its Standing Committee as well as State Council “regulations” (xingzheng fagui) and central departmental and local government “rules” (guizhang). Non-legislative documents include decisions and orders issued by government agencies, which are referred to literally as administrative normative documents (xingzheng guifanxing wenjian) but translated here as “regulatory documents,” in line with the State Council’s current practice. The formulation and handling of legislative documents are governed by China’s Legislation Law. In contrast, non-legislative regulatory documents are not subject to the Legislation Law, even though they are considered generally binding.
Regulatory documents are defined in the Circular as official documents, other than State Council regulations, decisions and orders, and departmental and local government rules, that are formulated by a government authority according to statutory powers and procedures, publicly issued, involve the rights and obligations of the public, and have a general binding force and applicability within a certain period of time.
Regulatory documents may impact the public by imposing user fees, standards, and certification requirements. Some of these documents have been characterized as “bizarre” for exceeding the bounds of reasonable administration—such as by forbidding employees from taking a vacation—and the State Council has long sought to reduce the volume of and better manage regulatory documents.

The Circular reflects the continuing struggle to manage regulatory documents. It mandates government agency compliance with its requirements through the use of language like “must” (bixu and yao) as opposed to “should” (ying), which is more typical of policy documents. “Significant” (zhongyao) documents must undergo five procedures that echo those required for rulemakings, although without comparable detailed procedural requirements: (1) assessment and appraisal of their necessity, feasibility and reasonableness; (2) widely soliciting the public’s opinions; (3) legality review; (4) collective deliberation and decision, to prevent arbitrary actions; and (5) public issuance as a condition of enforceability.
Although “significant” is not expressly defined, public opinion solicitation is required for documents that involve the public’s “vital interests” or have a “major” (zhongda) impact on their rights and interests. When proposed documents impact major public interests, in-depth investigations and studies through such channels as forums, expert appraisal meetings, and site visits must be undertaken to adequately obtain input from stakeholders.
The Circular prohibits government authorities from issuing, without a proper legal basis, regulatory documents that increase their own powers or reduce their statutory obligations. It likewise prohibits the issuance of documents that impair the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations or increase their obligations, or that infringe upon citizens’ personal, property, personality or labor rights.

Business regulation is also explicitly addressed in the Circular. Governments may not, without legal authority, undertake to do any of the following: establish new licensing requirements, penalties or compulsory measures, or add conditions for licensing; require duplicative or unnecessary certification; impose measures that eliminate or restrict fair competition; intervene in or interfere with normal business production and activities; or establish market access and exit conditions.
China’s new Foreign Investment Law specifies that regulatory documents relating to foreign invested enterprises must be formulated in accordance with the above requirements and published in a timely manner. A March 2019 State Council notice further urges central and local agencies to create a law-based, internationalized, and facilitative business environment by obtaining advice from affected enterprises, trade associations, chambers of commerce, and lawyers associations when drafting business-related regulatory documents.
All regulatory documents must also undergo a review, numbering, and registration process, and they must be periodically re-examined—including at the request of the public. As circumstances change, they should be “cleaned up” (qingli) through amendment or repeal. For example, the State Council released an instruction last June to abolish by the end of 2018 all certification requirements based on regulatory documents.
A further constraint on regulatory documents is afforded by the right, under the revised Administrative Litigation Law, to challenge them in court when concurrently seeking review of the legality of a government agency action based on such documents. This “incidental review” is an exception to the rule that Chinese courts do not have the authority to directly review the legality or reasonableness of State Council regulations, rules or regulatory documents.
In such circumstances, China’s Supreme People’s Court (SPC), in a 2018 judicial interpretation of the revised Administrative Litigation Law, instructed Chinese courts to review the legality of regulatory documents if they exceed the drafting agency’s authority, did not comply with procedures including for publication, or otherwise violate the law. Furthermore, incidental review of regulatory documents is appropriate if the documents conflict with the provisions of higher-level laws, regulations, and rules, or, without a legal basis, increase the obligations, or reduce the lawful rights and interests, of the public.
The introduction of incidental review of regulatory documents may help to gradually expand the scope of judicial review of Chinese agency action more broadly. For now, the State Council and the impacted public hope that the new requirements, bolstered by incidental judicial review, will curb the abusive aspects of regulatory documents and promote transparency and more law-based governance in China.

Executive Summary
While America spent the past decade upgrading its bank based magnetic striped cards with chips, China experienced a retail payment revolution. Leapfrogging the card-based system, two new payment systems have come to dominate person-to-person, retail, and many business transactions. China’s new system is built on digital wallets, QR codes, and runs through their own big tech firms: Alipay running through Alibaba (China’s version of Amazon) and WeChat Pay running through Tencent (China’s version of Facebook).

China’s system largely disintermediates banks from payment transactions robbing banks of an important and long-standing source of revenue. It creates an alternative payment ecosystem with different incentives between merchants, consumers, and payment system providers. It challenges the long-standing placement of payments on the side of banking as opposed to commerce. In doing so, this system creates new incentives that could realign existing business models and relationships between merchants, banks, and technology providers.
China’s new payment system exploded in under a decade, growing from inception to dominance. With over a billion users on each platform, the power of network incentives has been unleashed. The new payment system has replaced cards and cash at registers, how families give gifts, and even how beggars ask for money, with QR codes replacing tin cups.

To reform the credit card industry, start with credit scores

Aaron Klein and Lisa Servon
Monday, May 20, 2019





What is the future of this system in China and globally? Will it replace the bankcard-based system that launched in America and took over the world? What does it mean to have a payment system migrate from the banks to tech?
This report goes into substantial detail on these and other important questions. The main findings are:

China’s new payment system is here to stay. It will continue to grow domestically and globally, following Chinese travelers and consumers abroad.
New technology makes possible the movement of the payment system away from banking and into technology and social networking. Technology and social network firms have other sources of data on which to base financial decisions such as providing credit. Alternative underwriting is likely to follow alternative payments.
The incentives created by moving the payment system from banking to technology firms are substantial and potentially concerning. The potential for anti-competitive behavior and privacy concerns by tech platforms by using the payment system and data generated from it are real. However, it is not clear whether these concerns can and would be remedied by effective regulation.
The economics of China’s system are beneficial for merchants but bad for Chinese banks, especially in the short-run.
The Chinese system is unlikely to catch on in America, but may be more viable in other countries with less developed banking systems.
America’s existing system has multiple impediments to the Chinese model, or a similar one, taking over:

Wealthier consumers benefit more from substantial rewards linked to the current payment system;
Merchants may have difficulty transitioning and generating substantial savings from a new system;
Consumer behavior is sticky;
Existing regulatory systems provide substantial consumer protection through the bank-based system that may be lost in a non-bank payment system.


The American legal and regulatory framework is not well prepared should payments move from banking to non-banking.

How will China reform its economy as it aspires to become the next economic superpower?
It’s clear that China is the world’s next economic superpower. But what isn’t so clear is how China will get there by the middle of this century. It now faces tremendous challenges such as fostering innovation, dealing with ageing problem and coping with a less accommodative global environment.
In this book, economists from China’s leading university and America’s best-known think tank offer in depth analyses of these challenges. Does China have enough talent and right policy and institutional mix to transit from input-driven to innovation-driven economy? What does ageing mean, in terms of labor supply, consumption demand and social welfare expenditure? Can China contain the environmental and climate change risks? How should the financial system be transformed in order to continuously support economic growth and keep financial risks under control? What fiscal reforms are required in order to balance between economic efficiency and social harmony? What roles should the state-owned enterprises play in the future Chinese economy? In addition, how will technological competition between the United States and China affect each country’s development? Will the Chinese yuan emerge as a major reserve currency, and would this destabilize the international financial system? What will be China’s role in the international economic institutions? And will the United States and other established powers accept a growing role for China and the rest of the developing world in the governance of global institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, or will the world devolve into competing blocs?
This book provides unique insights into independent analyses and policy recommendations by a group of top Chinese and American scholars. Whether China succeeds or fails in economic reform will have a large impact, not just on China’s development, but also on stability and prosperity for the whole world.

270,/article/idUSKBN2433GN,China rejects U.S. criticism of military drills in South China Sea,"By Reuters Staff3 Min ReadWASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday rejected criticism by the U.S. Defense Department of its plan to hold military exercises in the South China Sea, and suggested that Washington was to blame for increased tensions in the region.The Pentagon said in a statement on Thursday that conducting military exercises over disputed territory in the South China Sea was “counter-productive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability”.China announced last week it had scheduled five days of drills starting July 1 near the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both Vietnam and China.“The military exercises are the latest in a long string of PRC actions to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea,” the Pentagon statement said, referring to the People’s Republic of China.Vietnam and the Philippines have also criticized the planned Chinese drills, warning it could create tension in the region and impact Beijing’s relationship with its neighbors.Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin warned China on Friday “it will be met with the severest response, diplomatic and whatever else is appropriate” should the exercises spill over to Philippine territory.“To be sure, China is just as entitled, as any other power, to invoke freedom of navigation in its military exercises. But that freedom, it bears reminding, requires a straight and uninterrupted voyage,” Locsin said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, asked about the Pentagon’s comments during a daily briefing in Beijing, said the military exercises are within the scope of China’s sovereignty and said that certain “non-regional countries” conducting military exercises in the South China Sea are affecting the region’s stability.Zhao did not name any countries, but the United States has conducted multiple freedom of navigation operations by sending its warships through the area to assert the freedom of access to international waterways.The United States accuses China of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.Reporting by Eric Beech in Washington and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

China has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.Australia has long advocated for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and for all claimants to resolve their differences in compliance with international laws.Its more outspoken position on China’s claims comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month China had offered no coherent legal basis for its ambitions in the South China Sea and for years has been using intimidation against other coastal states.The world would not allow China to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire, Pompeo said, adding that the United States would support countries that believed China has violated their maritime claims.The United States has long opposed China’s expansive territorial claims on the South China Sea, sending warships regularly through the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation.Australia’s declaration on China’s claims comes as its foreign and defence ministers prepare to travel to Washington to attend a bilateral forum on July 28, the government said.Diplomatic tension between China and Australia has worsened recently over various issues including an Australian call for an international enquiry into the novel coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Robert BirselOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The federal deficit temporarily ballooned in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but remarkably low interest rates, expected to continue for much of the coming decade, mean the long-term budget outlook is only moderately worse now, finds a paper that was discussed at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA) conference on September 24.

“Because low interest rates create ‘breathing room’ for fiscal policy, we do not see the large short-run debt accumulation … as necessitating any immediate offsetting response,” write Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California-Berkeley, William Gale and Louise Sheiner of the Brookings Institution, and Byron Lutz of the Federal Reserve Board. However, they warn, “long-term projections show that significant fiscal imbalances remain and will eventually require attention.”
Meanwhile, state and local governments, which generally must balance their budgets, entered the pandemic in a relatively strong position, with $119 billion in rainy day funds and general budget surpluses. Nevertheless, they will require additional federal assistance to avoid cutting necessary services in the years ahead, the authors write in Fiscal effects of COVID-19.
Federal borrowing surged between April and June, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects, based on the continuation of current law, that the ratio of accumulated federal debt to gross domestic product (GDP) will jump from 79 percent in fiscal year 2019 to 98 percent this year and then to 104 percent next year, just short of the record 106 percent reached after the end of World War II.

By 2030, the CBO projects, the ratio will rise to 109 percent, compared with its pre-COVID projection of 98 percent. Longer-term, rising spending on health-related programs and Social Security drive inexorably increasing deficits even though projected low interest rates slow the rate of debt accumulation until the early 2040s. The authors, using CBO assumptions for growth and interest rates, project that the debt under current law rises to 190 percent by 2050—somewhat higher than the CBO’s pre-COVID projection of 180 percent. However, the authors caution that, with certain assumptions for continued policy, such as the extension of the 2017 tax cuts beyond their expiration date, the ratio would soar to 222 percent by 2050. They also show that the projections are sensitive to predictions about the path of interest rates.
At the state and local level, because of the unusual nature of the current recession, the authors use a bottom-up approach to estimate the pandemic’s fiscal impact rather than relying on the historical relationships between the economy and state and local tax revenues.
For instance, they estimate smaller income tax losses, in part because high-income workers—who pay more in taxes—have been less affected by the recession than low-income workers. Pandemic-related federal spending on unemployment benefits and grants to small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program likely will boost state income tax revenue. And, because the stock market bounced back strongly over the summer, capital gains taxes won’t be significantly affected.
However, social distancing has reduced state and local taxes and fees related to health care, entertainment, gambling and, in particular, transportation. Also, the drop in consumption during this recession has been far larger than typical, depressing sales taxes. On the other hand, consumption has fallen most sharply on services, which are mostly untaxed.
The authors note that state and local governments are due to receive $250 billion in federal aid this year, including aid to public colleges and hospitals, although smaller states received much more generous aid relative to their losses than states like New York and California. In the aggregate, the federal aid this year exceeds the projected state and local revenue loss of $188 billion in 2020.
“But that doesn’t mean the aid has been sufficient to preclude tough budget choices and poor macroeconomic outcomes,” the authors write. These governments are facing a multiple year shortfall in revenue. And, because the pandemic has likely increased the need for state and local spending in areas such as public health, help for the elderly, and virtual schooling, “simply maintaining pre-COVID levels of spending may not be enough to ensure that necessary services aren’t cut,” they write.

The global spread of COVID-19 is transforming politics, as are the wide-ranging responses from governments and communities worldwide. The implications will endure well after the pandemic is behind us. Both jihadi-linked terrorism and counterterrorism are likely to change as well. The pandemic, however, offers new opportunities for terrorists and poses distinct challenges for the governments that seek to combat them.
Budgets shrink, public health costs swell
The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession in eight decades and the global economy is expected to lose $8.5 trillion in output over the next two years. The economic fallout will be especially devastating to countries in the developing world and those dependent on oil revenue — characteristics of many Western counterterrorism partners in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Developing economies are already saddled with fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt, while oil-producing states have suffered a collapse of oil demand and prices.

Public health spending will almost certainly take up a larger portion of shrinking budgets among Western nations and regional counterterrorism partners. The direct medical costs of treating patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the costs associated with preventing its spread and distributing a vaccine, will probably reach hundreds of billions of dollars. Overall counterterrorism budgets may decline as a result, and drive a reduction in European and other allied assistance to local partners, many of whom are dependent on Western support for funds, training, and weapons to pursue terrorist groups operating inside their countries. Face-to-face military training is already declining as fears of COVID-19 limit interactions. A loss or drastic reduction in foreign support would erode those local allies’ counterterrorism capabilities and could allow terrorists to expand their operations and influence. An even bigger risk, as a recent U.N. report notes, may be the distraction of security forces, which might need to support a COVID-19 response or manage any unrest associated with the crisis.
Policy focus shifts
The public health and economic crises will also likely reorder national security priorities. That may accelerate existing trends identified by the Department of Defense away from jihadi-focused counterterrorism and quicken an overall desire to reduce commitments in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, where ISIS and al-Qaida and their affiliates have been traditionally most active. Along with reduced spending on foreign assistance, fewer demands and less attention from senior U.S. and Western leaders may mean partners in the developing world focus on other issues. The regionalization of many jihadi groups compounds this challenge. Reduced Western attention to managing counterterrorism coordination, compounded by reduced foreign aid, would greatly increase the need for local partners to manage regional multilateral cooperation, which has often been strained, if not absent, due to suspicion and regional rivalry.

The terrorist threat is likely to morph in both the short and long term. Well before the pandemic, the jihadi terrorist threat was localizing, with the energy — and much of the violence — concentrated in the Middle East, East and West Africa, and other parts of the world where groups like ISIS and al-Qaida had local affiliates or otherwise focused on the immediate conflict rather than spectacular international terrorist attacks. COVID-19 is likely to make this localization more pronounced. Terrorists, like everyone else, face both overall restrictions on travel and greater border security in the United States and in other countries. This makes action at home relatively easier and accelerates the pre-existing trend toward homegrown attacks.
Local allies under pressure
Making the threat more dangerous, at the local level at least, is that governments will be both over-stretched and discredited in many countries where terrorist groups are operating. In much of the Middle East and Africa, governments are weak and dysfunctional, and the pandemic has brought this to the fore. Many report low numbers of cases simply because they are not collecting data at all, even as the virus runs amok. Government resources are likely to focus on the pandemic and on quelling any unrest that stems from the poor government response. In the long term, the poor response to the pandemic will be another strike against these regimes, further delegitimizing them and bolstering militants’ claim that the governments should be overthrown. The contrast between good and bad governance, so clear with COVID-19, will also exacerbate the terrorism threat for those who fall short. Terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS are attempting to take advantage of this weak governance to expand their operations. In addition, in some areas a group may try to provide services and, in so doing, bolster its own credibility as an alternative.
Another risk is more insidious: that governments will use the threat of terrorism to increase their efforts to crack down on legitimate dissent. This has long been the case in China, where the government played up a real but small threat of Uighur terrorism, using it as justification for a crackdown on millions of Chinese Muslims, including comprehensive surveillance and detention camps. China is trying to suppress the democratic movement in Hong Kong, using COVID-19 as a pretext. 
Terrorists face new burdens
The pandemic is also likely to disrupt terrorist group operations and fundraising. In part, this is due to travel restrictions. In addition, however, terrorists compete for recruits and resources with other causes. As world and local attention focuses on the pandemic, the ability of terrorist groups to publicize their causes is crowded out — the world is not more for them or more against them, it is simply ignoring them.
The shift online, which is particularly pronounced in the white supremacist world, is likely to grow as a result of the pandemic. Stuck at home, it is harder to get to a training camp or a conflict zone, but people have more time to spend in virtual cesspools where extremism dwells. So far, judging by the decline in flows of foreign fighters, terrorists have had little success exploiting the coronavirus in their propaganda, but they in general are good at exploiting conspiracy theories and otherwise taking advantage of dangerous and misguided ideas that others promulgate.
Silver linings for counterterrorism? 
The challenges that COVID-19 poses for counterterrorism in the coming years are evident, if not entirely unique — yet some opportunities may also exist. For instance, information sharing and policy coordination among states on public health issues to help stem the pandemic may create more information, new means of sharing, and facilitate intra- and intergovernmental cooperation among regional and Western countries that could bolster counterterrorism efforts by improving travel monitoring and border control, for example. More broadly, the potential reduction in resources available for counterterrorism and shifting priorities will probably require reevaluating the efficacy and sustainability of various counterterrorism efforts, ranging from the use of military force to security-related foreign aid. Necessity may help drive regional cooperation and the development of sustainable, locally developed approaches to counterterrorism that are less dependent on the technical capabilities and sophisticated weapons systems provided by Western states.

The U.S. jobs market started recovering relatively soon after tanking in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, but only modestly, according to two papers discussed at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA) conference on June 25.
Some businesses shuttered in March and April are resuming operations, but often with fewer employees than before the pandemic, according to the papers.
One paper—The U.S. labor market during the beginning of the pandemic recession— also found that employers are cutting the wages of about 11 percent of workers (about twice as many as during the 2007-2009 recession) and skipping scheduled pay increases for others. It analyzed weekly payroll data from Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Inc., covering about 26 million workers.
Its authors are Tomaz Cajner, Leland D. Crane, Ryan A. Decker, Adrian Hamins-Puertolas, and Christopher Kurz of the Federal Reserve Board; Erik Hurst and John Grigsby of the University of Chicago; and Ahu Yildirmaz of ADP.
Their payroll data show that job losses were concentrated among low-wage workers: 37 percent of workers in the bottom fifth of the wage distribution lost their jobs through late April, compared with 9 percent of workers in the top fifth, and 21 percent of employees overall. The rebound has been modest so far. By late May, employment overall was still 15 percent below pre-pandemic levels and, for low-wage workers, 30 percent.
Women experienced sharper employment declines than men—about 4 percentage points more through late April—and very little of the decline is because women work disproportionately in businesses—restaurants and retailers—that have been hard hit by the pandemic, according to the paper. The gap widened slightly through May even as some businesses recalled workers, it said.

“We speculate it could be that the availability of childcare is driving the pattern,” Hurst said in an interview with The Brookings Institution.
The ADP data also suggests that roughly one-third of the employment rebound in May can be attributed to the reopening of temporarily shuttered business, especially businesses with fewer than 50 employees. (Many other businesses continued operating through the pandemic but reduced employment.) For the most part, reopening firms are recalling original employees rather than hiring new ones. That’s a positive trend, Hurst said, because long spells of unemployment, by eroding workers’ skills and attachment to the workforce, can have long-lasting effects.
However, he warned, that at least so far, “when firms are coming back, they are coming back at a fraction of their original size—about 40 percent of employment relative to February.”
A second paper—Measuring the labor market at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis— also found that reopening businesses are primarily recalling former employees rather than hiring new ones—but only some of them. It found that older workers, Black and Asian workers, and unmarried workers have been less likely to start work again.
Its authors—Alexander W. Bartik of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Marianne Bertrand and Feng Lin of the University of Chicago; and Jesse Rothstein and Matthew Unrath of the University of California at Berkeley—examined monthly government labor market reports as well as daily timeclock data on roughly 500,000 workers from Homebase, a firm that provides scheduling software to small businesses, including restaurants, retailers, and personal service providers. They also looked at surveys of employees at firms using Homebase.
The authors found that the pandemic recession has been very different from recent recessions, such as the 2007-2009 recession. In this one, economic activity collapsed and bottomed out in a few weeks, compared with months or years. The downturn was driven by service businesses such as restaurants and retailers rather than the typically more cyclical manufacturing and construction industries. Also, many more laid-off workers in this recession were expecting to get their jobs back, at least initially.
Like the first paper, the second paper found that job losses in the pandemic recession were concentrated among low-wage workers and that women experienced sharper employment declines than men. It also found that workers 65 and older and younger than 25 were more likely to lose work in April than workers in the 25-to-34 age group. It said workers without a high school degree were 10 percentage points more likely to have stopped working than otherwise similar employees with college degrees. Black workers were 4.6 percent more likely than similar white workers to lose work; Asian workers 5.2 percent more likely; and Hispanic workers, 1.6 percent more likely.
“These inequities in the distribution of job loss were for the most part not offset by rehiring in May,” the authors write. They found, in particular, that older workers, Black and Asian workers, and unmarried workers “were more likely to lose their jobs in April and, having done so, less likely to start work again in May.”

They also looked at the job market effects of two policy responses to the pandemic—a temporary $600-a-week supplement to unemployment benefits (which vary by state) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which offered small business loans that are forgivable if recipients meet employee-retention requirements. They found that states that received more PPP loans and states with more generous unemployment insurance benefits had milder declines and faster recoveries. And they found no evidence to support the view that the temporary $600 supplement, which meant many workers received benefits higher than their wages, drove job losses or slowed rehiring substantially.

The COVID-19 crisis could be a very severe stress event for the nation’s bank, one even more so than the severe scenario in the Federal Reserve’s recent stress tests. At least, there’s a pretty fat tail out there, and the banks need to be resilient to that fat tail. They need to have enough resources to continue lending, to keep credit flowing, to reduce the scarring—a lot of which will happen anyway, but even more of it will if the banks don’t continue to lend. I think conserving that bank capital, building the capital, is key.
I want to make two points.
One, is there a regime built around the dynamic resilience? Yes, there is in the U.K., and I’ve been part of it as a member of the Financial Policy Committee. I also think that the U.S. capital regime was moving in the wrong direction before this stress event. Capital requirements from the stress test had fallen. The framework was becoming less countercyclical, and I’ll explain why I think that, and have a recommendation for it.
So, what have we been doing in the U.K.? For 5 years or so, we had a countercyclical counter buffer (CCyB) that was set at one percentage point in a standard risk environment. Last year we decided we wanted to make it two percentage points in a standard risk environment. We did it in part by looking, as Michael Blank, Samuel Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam do in their working paper, at the global financial crisis, and we could see that the buildup of capital before that crisis to make banks resilient would have had to be much larger than one or two percentage points. We questioned whether, if we had started from one, we could have gotten the CCyB up to the three and a half to five that the staff estimated we would have needed. We might have trouble even starting from two, say, in 2003 or 2004, but at least we would have a better chance of getting it to where it needed to be to make the banking system resilient. Going from one to two in a steady state would add a little bit to tier one capital requirements—about a quarter of a percentage point. It wasn’t a big increase, but a little increase in the quantity and quality of capital.
Our stress test helps the Financial Policy Committee decide on what the CCyB should be. As in the U.S., we make the test countercyclical. So the lower the unemployment rate is, the bigger the increase in the unemployment rate. The higher the property prices, the greater the fall in property prices are. We also look at the stress environment or the financial environment, the risk environment globally; in the past couple of years, our stress test has produced larger drawdowns in U.K. capital, importantly because of our perception of rising global risk, including leverage in U.S. businesses and leverages in China. We also believe releasing the CCyB can be an effective macroprudential tool to enable and encourage banks to lend once stresses materialize. I think the important point is it adds to the amount of capital that can be drawn down before banks get to a spot in the capital stack in which they might be required to cut back on dividends or share buybacks or bonuses paid to top management. So, it gives a bit of a cushion that banks should be willing to use.
So, we have released the CCyB twice, once in the market volatility to follow the Brexit referendum in June of 2016, and again just a couple of months ago in the COVID-19 stress. I think an important point is, we started from a standard risk environment with the buffer on the way to one in 2016 and on the way to two in 2020. It wasn’t the financial system that caused the stress, it came from somewhere else, but releasing the buffer gave the banks a way of lending so the banks wouldn’t be amplifying the stress.
With respect to the dividend issue, in 2016 we said that the banks could not use the released capital to increase their dividends. Of course, in 2020, the Bank of England, with the strong support of the financial policy committee has convinced the banks that they shouldn’t pay any dividends at all to conserve capital and should cut way back on cash bonuses to management.
“Building buffers on top of the basic requirements gets capital high enough so that in a stress event they will survive…The taxpayers are not required to step in.”
In addition, we have emphasized that buffers are usable, including the capital conservation buffer. Buffers serve two purposes. Building buffers on top of the basic requirements gets capital high enough so that in a stress event they will survive, which is especially important for systemically important institutions. The taxpayers are not required to step in. The second point is the one I’ve been emphasizing, that buffers give capital that can be drawn down in a stress to keep lending flowing and prevent banks from amplifying an already bad event. I think we’re in the middle of a test of that second rationale. Will the banks actually lend using the buffers, the management buffers they built up, the extra that they’ve gotten from the CCyB? How will markets view declines in capital and liquidity metrics, and will banks be willing to test how markets might view that? We’ve already restricted dividends and buybacks in the UK, so the threat of getting into the distribution restriction territory is much less, but still, it’s not clear how banks are going to deal with this. We hope and we will encourage them to recognize the externality in their lending. It’s in everyone’s collective interest that they all continue to loan and use the capital that they’ve built up because that makes the economy stronger, which in turn will reduce their losses.
The U.S., in contrast to the U.K., has been going in the wrong direction with its capital structure.  The U.S. stress test is said to be the marginal capital constraint for many large banks. In updating a paper that Nellie Liang and I wrote, we showed that in 2019, the stress capital buffer, the capital buffer that fell out of the stress test, fell, and fell substantially. This result occurred in a situation in which the unemployment rate was falling. So, you would think the stress would be greater; the capital would be higher. Business leverage was rising. The risk environment was getting worse. Yet the required capital went down.
I think the Stein et al. paper for this webinar showed very, very clearly the starting point for capital in the stress is critical. The increases we’ve had in capital and liquidity from the regulatory reforms after 2009 have meant that the banks have been able to play a constructive role in 2020. It’s concerning that the 2019 stress test implied that the authorities were okay with that starting point declining, and particularly at a time when the banks were already talking about drawing down their management buffers.
And not only was there downward pressure on the starting place, but the changes in the stress test regime have weakened the countercyclical aspects of the stress test. Much of the countercyclicality that was in the stress test came from the requirement that banks in stress had to prefund eight quarters of dividends and share repurchases. Naturally, planned dividends and share repurchase rise in good times and fall in bad times. So, the prefunding requirement gave a bit of a higher capital stress requirement in good times and scaled it back in bad times. But that prefunding requirement has been scaled back to four quarters of dividends from eight or nine quarters of dividends and share buybacks. That’s much less countercyclical capital requirement from the stress tests.
A second point that’s been changed in the stress test is the Fed used to impose a soft limit of 30 percent of dividends as a proportion of distributions. They’ve eliminated that limit and allowed dividends to rise relative to share buybacks. We have seen graphically illustrated in the current environment, that it’s much easier to cut share repurchases than to cut dividends. Encouraging or allowing dividends to rise relative to share repurchases goes against the countercyclicality of the macroprudential requirement.
Finally, the test now assumes a constant balance sheet, rather than the small increase that it had assumed before for bank lending and risk related assets. I think it’s important that banks be able to fund and capitalize against increases in lending, even in a stress environment. Now, that requirement has been reduced.
“Fed and the other U.S. authorities [should] use the current experience to…reevaluate the public interest and costs and benefits of the way they were moving with the stress tests.”
So, my recommendation is that the Fed and the other U.S. authorities use the current experience to think very hard, to reevaluate the public interest and costs and benefits of the way they were moving with the stress tests, and the effect it was likely to have making bank capital more rather than less countercyclical. Moreover, I think the U.S. should adopt the framework of dynamic resilience with a positive countercyclical buffer in standard risk environments. As we’ve seen, stresses don’t always originate in the financial sector. So, waiting until the financial sector gives you a signal for raising the countercyclical buffer is too late. Things happen that mean that the public interest is served by releasing that buffer. This is the dynamic resilience that Jeremy and others were talking about. Release the capital buffer in a stress in order to give banks more incentive to keep lending. For the starting point in the standard risk environment, you’ve got to have enough capital to allow that capital to be released, while still keeping the markets and the microprudential regulators comfortable that bank solvency has not been compromised.

Understanding the effects of bank stress tests: A Q&A

Humans are bad at assessing risk even in the best of times. During a pandemic—when the disease is unfamiliar, people are isolated and stressed, and the death toll is rising—our risk perception becomes even more distorted, with fear often overwhelming reason. This is a recipe for disastrous policy mistakes.

To be sure, the danger posed by the COVID-19 outbreak should not be underestimated. The experiences of Italy, Spain, and the United States, in particular, have shown that delayed action to limit the virus’s spread can lead to large-scale illness and death.
But blind panic does nobody any good. In many countries, especially in the developing world, it is leading to policies that generate more risks—such as economic hardship, food insecurity, and generalized anxiety—than they mitigate. Smart policymaking will require leaders and citizens alike to gain a broader perspective.
While it’s difficult to know COVID-19’s precise fatality rate, we are much better at counting fatalities than the number of people who are infected, since the latter requires testing on a massive scale. And from the fatality data, it is evident that the risk of death remains very low for most people—that is, anyone who is not elderly and has no comorbidities. In most developing countries, one has a much higher chance of dying in a road accident than from COVID-19. In India, more than 150,000 people die in road accidents each year.
But most people are not nervous wrecks when they drive on a highway, whereas many have been terrified to go outside since the pandemic began. The large literature in psychology on “salience” helps us understand this, as the Nobel laureate economist George Akerlof has shown.
Say you were looking to buy the safest-possible car. You would probably read up on models’ safety data—how many electronic or mechanical failures, accidents, or fatalities occurred for every, say, 10,000 cars on the road—and choose the model with the lowest number. But the night before you plan to purchase the car, you meet up with a friend, who tells you that a skidding accident in the model you’ve chosen left their cousin gravely injured just a week after he started driving it.

This conversation would cause many people to doubt—and even change—their decision, because the risk their chosen car poses is now more salient than the dry data about 10,000 cars.
Even the way the numbers themselves are presented can distort the picture. If one list shows the total number of accidents involving various kinds of cars, one brand may appear to be doing far worse than others, simply because it is more popular. It might seem obvious that accident rates are more important than the total number of accidents, yet that nuance can be lost, especially when fear is involved.
Something similar is occurring today with COVID-19 data. In recent weeks, people all over the world have been watching the number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus-related deaths climb steadily, to nearly 70,000. This is, of course, far more than Belgium’s 8,000 deaths. But, per ten million residents, Belgium’s record (just under 8,000) is far worse than America’s (about 2,120). As of now, a person in Belgium is more than three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than someone in the U.S..

The difference between death rates in North America and Europe, on the one hand, and Africa and Asia, on the other, is even starker. The chances that a person will die from COVID-19 in Europe is typically 2,000-4,000 times higher than in Africa or South Asia. Even when considering only the better-performing European countries, the gap is large: The risk of COVID-19 fatality in Germany is about 100 times higher than in India.
The risk of destitution, however, is much higher in India than in Germany. Yet, rather than factor these differences into their policymaking, many developing-countries have focused single-mindedly on mitigating the ultra-salient, but statistically low risk of dying from COVID-19.
The costs of this approach are mounting. In emerging economies in Africa and South Asia, prolonged lockdowns represent a trade-off not between saving lives and saving stock prices, but between saving some lives from COVID-19 and condemning far more people to destitution, hunger, and death by other means.
Some will argue that this conclusion is premature. Sri Lanka, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, which have low fatality rates today, could face a devastating wave of infections tomorrow. Policymakers must anticipate future risks and act early to mitigate them.
But it is not at all clear that the outbreak will follow the same trajectory in South Asia and Africa as it has in Europe and North America. The magnitude of the differences between all countries in Africa and South Asia, and virtually all countries in North America and Europe is large enough to suggest that other factors may affect COVID-19 virus transmission. One possibility is widespread use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis, in South Asia and Africa, where TB and malaria infections are far more common.
This is not to say that developing-country leaders should not prepare for future risks, especially given how much we still don’t know about COVID-19. They certainly must not dismiss or downplay the risks, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has done, even as the bodies pile up.
But leaders must also avoid counterproductive, fear-driven responses. Instead, they must make difficult but balanced choices based on accurate data and expert advice; adapt their policies as information and conditions change; and keep people informed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are both models of such leadership.
The same goes for citizens. To help protect our communities, we must take all appropriate and feasible public-health precautions, such as wearing masks and minimizing physical contact, especially with vulnerable people. We must recognize, however, that a large part of such behavior is necessary not because of the risk to oneself, but because of the social responsibility that confronting an infectious disease necessarily implies.

291,https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-covid-19-means-for-americas-child-welfare-system/,What COVID-19 means for America’s child welfare system,"
The COVID-19 crisis has allowed a revealing look into the shortcomings of the U.S.’s child welfare system. While no institution has proved strong enough to operate effectively and efficiently under the unprecedented circumstances brought on by COVID-19, the crisis has unveiled holes in the child welfare system that call for both immediate and long-term action. COVID-19 has created a perfect storm of factors that will almost certainly lead to a sharp increase in unreported cases of child abuse and neglect, as children are cut off from interactions with professionals and teachers, confined at home with caregivers and relatives, and families are feeling the stress of job loss and economic uncertainty. The nation’s system of detecting abuse and neglect, which is heavily dependent on reports by teachers, doctors, and other professionals, is rendered almost completely powerless in this new situation as in-person and face-to-face interactions between children and professionals are being minimized by the stay-at-home orders issued by most states. At the same time, other vital parts of the child welfare system – home investigations, child-parent visits, mandatory court appearances, home-based parenting programs – are now at a near standstill, making it harder and harder for the system to ensure the safety and well-being of the nearly 3.5 million children they come into contact with each year. While these issues are at the forefront, the crisis provides an opportunity to re-think and restructure child welfare at its core.

The child welfare system has long struggled with a lack of clear program structure and overall philosophy driving the mission. America’s child welfare system is composed of public agencies, private entities, and community-based organizations that come together to ensure both the safety and well-being of children by detecting child abuse or neglect and responding appropriately. While federal laws and funding influence state actions, the United States lacks a clear strategy for addressing child abuse and neglect, and thus the oversight of child protection falls heavily on the states. This in turn causes program structure, service delivery, and overall approach to vary greatly across states. These factors, among many others, contribute to a system without clear guidance, which has long been faced with two conflicting priorities – child protection vs. family preservation. These two priorities are difficult to reconcile since it is imperative to ensure that children are not at imminent physical and emotional risk at the hands of their parents, but at the same time research shows that children do best with their parents and will face negative outcomes if they are removed. While federal policy tends to swing the pendulum towards child safety or family preservation every decade or so, the reconciliation falls into the hands of Child Protective Services (CPS), which are the state or local agencies that are responsible for screening reports of child abuse and neglect and making the decision concerning whether abuse or neglect has actually occurred, and then determining the appropriate response.
The crisis provides an opportunity to re-think and restructure child welfare at its core.
The scope of CPS has grown extensively over the years to the point where now the pressure and expectation has grown so burdensome that the agencies are not able to effectively fulfill their mission. CPS agencies are tasked with preventing, assessing, and resolving child maltreatment with few effective tools and little oversight. The current system ignores the fact that most of the families that come to the attention of CPS are facing issues that contribute to, yet span beyond child maltreatment – poverty, economic uncertainty, homelessness, substance use disorders. When families come to the attention of CPS, a case worker is being asked to ensure the immediate safety of a child, while also remedying the underlying issues that often fall beyond their competence. Coupled with this is the fact that the child welfare system, by design, is reactionary. Since we are usually unable to support families before an instance of child abuse or neglect is suspected or occurs, we are constrained to reacting after children come to the attention of CPS.
These realities have caused the child welfare system to struggle to address the unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The isolation of families and other institutions, coupled with the reactionary nature of the system, has deprived CPS agencies of the proper tools to identify, investigate, and support children that may be victims of maltreatment. The COVID-19 crisis may be the push needed for us to examine and re-build a child welfare system that is able to recognize and address the risk factors that lead to child maltreatment and support families, while ensuring the safety of all children. However, we are now trapped in a time-sensitive situation and must evaluate and address the current issues, even while being constrained by the flawed system design and limited resources. The system must quickly find new ways of adapting to the social distancing restrictions and accompanying financial hardships as the current economic and public health crisis threatens to take a heavy toll on our nation’s most vulnerable population of children and youth.
Barriers to reporting child maltreatment
The most immediate effect of the pandemic is the decline in reported cases of child maltreatment, which is expected to continue as children and youth are kept away from their schools, regular doctor check-ups, and organized outdoor activities for the duration of the pandemic. States such as Wisconsin, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Illinois have already seen reports of child abuse fall by between 20% and 70% in the month of March. In most states, professionals that come in frequent contact with children and youth, such as teachers, pediatricians, daycare providers, lawyers, and police, are mandated reporters, meaning they have the legal duty of making a referral to the CPS hotline when they suspect child abuse or neglect. In 2018, 67.3% of reports (screened-in referrals) that came to the attention of CPS agencies came from professionals in these types of positions, with the most coming from teachers and other education personnel (20.5%). With nearly all states shutting down their schools through April (and many for the remainder of the academic year), as well as the shutdown of daycare facilities, after school programs and activities, and doctors’ offices operating on a limited basis, children are essentially cut off from most, if not all, of the professionals who are responsible for detecting and reporting suspected maltreatment. This could mean that child abuse cases will surface once it’s too late and the child has been admitted to the hospital with serious or life-threatening injuries, as we have seen in one Fort Worth Hospital.
In response to this growing concern, a few states, such as Mississippi and Tennessee, are calling on the general public to be extra diligent during this time, and report suspected child maltreatment to the CPS hotline if it comes to their attention. In these states, and many others, all residents are mandated reporters of child maltreatment, meaning that any person who suspects child abuse or neglect is required to make a referral. While the sentiment is right, in 2018, only 16.6% of child maltreatment reports came from nonprofessionals, i.e. friends, neighbors, and relatives. In addition, unlike the general public, professionals usually receive training related to mandated reporting and are aware of issues related to reporting biases. It has been found that reports made by professional mandated reporters were more likely to be substantiated as accurate than reports from non-mandated reporters or the general public. While the child welfare system needs all the help it can get to ensure the safety and well-being of children and youth, the general public has not been the most frequent or reliable source for child maltreatment reports – which is an issue that could further complicate and overburden the child welfare hotline and system for the duration of the current crisis.
Family isolation and economic uncertainty 
Since children are not attending school, participating in sports and clubs, or running around the neighborhood with their friends, they are spending their days indoors, presumably with their parents, caregivers, or relatives. This means that parents or caregivers are suddenly responsible for taking on the roles of teacher, friend, playmate, and coach, round-the-clock, while potentially still trying to complete their own job from home. For some parents, their jobs are deemed essential, and not only are they continuing to show-up for work every day and putting themselves at risk to provide life-saving or necessary services, they are also being hit hard by the added responsibility of child care since daycare centers and school facilities are closed.
When individuals and families encounter economic uncertainty, they experience increased stress, anxiety about the future, anger, and loss of hope.
There is another layer of stress for many Americans, as isolation also comes at a time of wide-spread job loss, economic uncertainty, and general anxiety surrounding employment and earnings. In the last two weeks of March, nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits, with 6.6 million claims coming from the last week of March alone. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, this is just the beginning. Currently, there are approximately 67 million jobs that are at high risk due to COVID-19, and the St. Louis Fed projects that the pandemic will result in a national loss of 47 million jobs in the next quarter. Research has found that economic uncertainty is associated with family stress that can result in adverse child-parent dynamics that may have effects on children’s behavior and mental health. There is also evidence that times of economic downturn are associated with increased child maltreatment. The Great Recession, for example, has been linked to an increased risk for child abuse.
In 2018, of the children who were deemed victims of maltreatment, 92% were abused or neglected by their parent or parents. Parents and individuals that are likely to maltreat their children often have or are exposed at the community level to risk factors that include neighborhood violence, poverty, unemployment, and drug and alcohol abuse. All of these risk factors are interwoven with economic deprivation and uncertainty. When individuals and families encounter economic uncertainty, they experience increased stress, anxiety about the future, anger, and loss of hope. These stressors, coupled with isolation and close proximity, put many families at risk of increased violence and aggression. Already many cities in the U.S. have seen a sharp increase in domestic abuse and violence as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. There is considerable evidence that domestic abuse and child maltreatment are linked, meaning that if the household experiences one type of family violence, the household is at increased risk of the other. And even if child maltreatment is not occurring in the same household as domestic violence, children are still at risk of adverse behavioral problems related to witnessing domestic violence, which can have detrimental and lasting effects on their development and behavior.
Navigating investigations
While agencies are confronted with the new challenge of keeping children safe despite the loss of their reporting sources, they are also responsible for navigating how, when, and if investigations can occur amidst social distancing and mandatory isolation. In 2018, 3.5 million children received either an investigation or alternative response (which is the CPS response when a child is suspected to be at low or moderate risk of maltreatment) as a result of a CPS report. Of these children, 678,000 were deemed to be victims of child maltreatment, and were either removed from their home or received services to keep them safely in the home. An investigation is crucial for social workers to gather information to make a proper judgement about a child’s safety and living arrangement. In order to properly investigate a report, a social worker usually visits the residence, talks to the parents, and talks to the child and other children in the home as well as others (doctors, teachers, relatives) who have frequent contact with the child. Without thorough investigations, the chances of determining whether abuse has occurred and the level of risk are greatly diminished.

Driving better outcomes for children in foster care

Ron Haskins
Thursday, February 14, 2019






The COVID-19 emergency has caused many states, such as Kentucky and Michigan, to issue guidance that will drastically scale back their in-home investigations to protect their workers and lessen the spread of the virus. Luckily, many agencies have been able to quickly adopt new approaches and embrace virtual means of investigation, such as the efforts being led in Michigan by Executive Director of the Children’s Services Agency, JooYeun Chang. However, it is still necessary for in-home investigations to take place in circumstances that may require immediate response or include serious domestic violence reports. For the home-investigations that are deemed critical, CPS staff must take all precautions necessary to lessen the spread of the virus, while ensuring a quality investigation. That means supplying CPS staff with personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves, so they can remain protected. However, this is easier said than done, as we know that in many cities, such as New York, there are already shortages of PPE for hospital staff and personnel. Unfortunately, this means that CPS workers are putting themselves, their families, and the families they serve at risk. Again, it is little wonder that social workers and CPS staff members in many states have tested positive for COVID-19.
Need for Immediate Response
We’ve laid out a laundry list of issues that CPS agencies have been tackling for the last few months, and while many of the issues must be resolved quickly and will only worsen as we dive deeper and deeper into isolation, the federal and state responses have been mixed. The first federal response bill, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law on March 18, authorized an increase of 6.2% to the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) that determines the split in funding between the federal and state governments in many child welfare related programs This policy signifies an increase in federal matching for Medicaid and for the Foster Care, Prevention, and Permanency program (Title IV-E), which allows states to provide foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments for children in the care that qualify. The second major federal response package, the CARES Act, which passed on March 30, boosted funding for expanded unemployment benefits, immediate income support for individuals, and increased funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which will provide direct relief for families with children who are struggling financially. The bill also allocates $6.3 billion in funding for the Administration for Children and Families, which has distributed the funds primarily to programs that assist low-income families with their energy bills and child care needs. Of the $6.3 billion, only $45 million is being directly appropriated to child welfare services administered by the states. These funds were appropriated to the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program (part of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act) to augment the $268 million they received in the current fiscal year. Both the $268 million and the new funds are intended to aid child welfare agencies in carrying out their mission of protecting children from abuse and neglect.
There is no doubt that the child welfare system is being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the emergency has also called attention to a system that could benefit from fundamental changes.
What’s Next?
While federal funding designed to help low-income families navigate this Coronavirus crisis is essential, the funding should include more to support child welfare agencies. The $45 million provided for CWS programs in the original legislation is a reasonable start, but additional funds specifically dedicated to helping child welfare agencies boost their technological infrastructure and provide protective equipment to workers who must investigate reports of abuse and family violence should be included in the next package .In addition, while the first package included an increase in the Title IV-E FMAP rate which provided a needed bump to the federal matching rate, another increase in the FMAP would give states the funding and flexibility needed to navigate the crisis and prepare for the future. However, more than increased funding will be needed. Much of the child welfare system relies heavily on community organizations, family members, and teachers to stay connected and provide a safety net for children and families who are at risk. During this time of isolation, it is essential for teachers and other trusted adults to continue to act as a support system – even if only virtually — for children who may be struggling or in a dangerous situation at home.
There is no doubt that the child welfare system is being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the emergency has also called attention to a system that could benefit from fundamental changes. In the long-run, it is possible that this crisis could act as a catalyst that causes us to reevaluate child protection at its core – how we support and treat families who are deemed to be at-risk of child abuse and neglect, and how we reconcile child safety and protection with family support and preservation, while recognizing the importance of both. Only time will tell how the burden of isolation and economic hardship on CPS, families, services providers, and community organizations may impact the safety and well-being of at-risk children. A speedy and organized response backed by additional funding, federal and state guidance, and community support, will soften the blow and help move the system into a more promising future.

In the run-up to this week’s Virtual Spring Meetings, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stepped up and provided much-needed leadership to assure countries and financial markets that they have the resources and tools necessary to help address the worst global economic crisis since the institution was created in 1945. But, precisely because the IMF is moving so aggressively to provide vital emergency support to countries seeking assistance, it is at risk of sometimes using overly optimistic assumptions to allow it to do so, finding some countries’ debt to be sustainable when, in fact, the COVID-19 crisis presents such vast uncertainty that no one knows whether it really is.

Rather than attempting to define as “sustainable” what could more fairly be classified as “uncertain,” we suggest that the IMF modify its lending policy to allow use of its emergency instruments into uncertain debt sustainability during a global or systemic crisis. This would afford countries a more transparent window into the risks they face, while still receiving the benefit of IMF financial support during this crisis. It would also provide private investors with a more realistic assessment of a country’s debt repayment prospects, avoiding the situation in which policymakers could ask investors to participate in a debt standstill or restructuring, while the IMF is simultaneously asserting that the country’s debt is nevertheless sustainable.  The IMF would maintain all current sustainability requirements for conditions-based programs. The introduction of this more flexible approach would apply only to the IMF’s emergency support instruments, and thus would not likely increase the likelihood of moral hazard abuse
IMF emergency instruments
Today, over 90 countries have already sought IMF support under its Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) emergency instruments. To respond to the emergency nature of crisis requests, this past week the IMF doubled the access limits of these facilities, making potentially $100 billion available to those in desperate need of financial support. Under current policy, the IMF can only provide those emergency funds if a country’s debt burden is found to be “sustainable.”  That sustainability threshold is determined by IMF staff, who generally undertake a Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), in order to analyze a country’s current and projected economic performance, fiscal policies, and debt exposures by running those figures through a standardized model. The output of the DSA determines whether that country’s debt is sustainable or not. In the context of the RFI and RCF, the outcome is binary. A country’s debt either is sustainable or it is not.  (This differs from large country programs, where, under the IMF’s Exceptional Access Policy, countries can fall into an uncertain area known as the “gray zone,” where their debt is considered sustainable, but without the required degree of confidence.)
In creating an IMF DSA, there can be a fair amount of discretion applied—a balance between art and science, with slight adjustments potentially altering binary outcomes. The art of the DSA is especially important for those countries where debt sustainability is too uncertain to determine with any real degree of confidence. Given that the COVID-19 crisis presents economists with unprecedented uncertainty in projecting economic outcomes, we suspect that an honest assessment of the debt sustainability of many countries currently requesting assistance would tilt more heavily into art over science, so as to attain the desired outcome of providing necessary support.
Rather than asking IMF staff to err on the side of potentially unwarranted optimism about economic risks, it would be better to ask IMF members to reinterpret lending requirements to allow for emergency lending, limited to the unique circumstances presented by this global crisis, to countries whose debt is found to be something other than sustainable. Those countries whose debt burdens were found to be unsustainable would continue to be prohibited from access to IMF funds absent measures to make the debt sustainable, but to those whose prospects are closer to the line, but simply too uncertain to assess, this approach would allow both creditors and countries the benefit of unadulterated IMF expert analysis, while still allowing the provision of IMF emergency support.
Purpose of IMF sustainability requirements
The IMF’s general policy requirement for finding that debt is sustainable before putting IMF resources at risk is understandable. The IMF is a lending institution, not a grant-making one. Its 189 member countries all provide publicly-sourced financial commitments to the IMF through various facilities. The IMF is primarily funded through its “quota,” which represents all member countries’ share of the IMF’s basic financing resource pool and is roughly based on each country’s share of the global economy. In addition to quota, the IMF can draw on two additional pools of resources: the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and a series of coordinated bilateral country credit lines called Bilateral Borrowing Arrangements (BBAs). Together these financial commitments represent roughly $1 trillion of resources. Ensuring that those public financial commitments are protected through strict financial safeguards has been central to the way the IMF has operated since its inception. Those who believe the IMF squanders taxpayer funds with little oversight could not be more mistaken. In fact, the IMF has strong financial safeguards and benefits from preferred creditor status, which prioritizes repayment to the IMF over that of all other private creditors and bilateral lenders.
Requiring debt sustainability also serves the interests of countries seeking IMF support. By requiring that debt is found to be sustainable before incurring more, it deters the buildup of unsustainable debts that are not likely to be repaid without more significant damage to the debtor country. This could result in forcing tighter austerity measures and hardship on the people allegedly being helped, and damaging the creditworthiness of the country, potentially increasing borrowing costs, or shutting down market access altogether.

Africa needs debt relief to fight COVID-19

Ordinarily, if a country’s debt is not found to be sustainable, the IMF can insist on measures to assure it will be repaid. For example, if other sources of funding remain available to fill gaps, the IMF can require that other funding be assured so that IMF funds remain safeguarded. In nonemergency program countries, the IMF will often request that the country undertake policy reforms that allow the country to reach a more sustainable equilibrium, allowing it to pay its debts while continuing to grow. Countries often use the IMF as a tool to allow them to undertake necessary, though politically unpopular economic reforms, with the IMF taking the “blame” for making its support contingent on undertaking those reforms.
Today, however, those normal processes do not apply. Market access for low-income and emerging markets is at best speculative and bilateral borrowing from countries enduring their own domestic stress is likely to be less forthcoming. Likewise, normal IMF conditionality around fiscal belt-tightening, structural reforms or other policy adjustments are inappropriate at a time when countries are focused on using already limited fiscal and monetary tools for immediate COVID-19 crisis response.
When neither policy adjustments nor ongoing financial support from other sources are available, the IMF would traditionally look for other ways to achieve debt sustainability, often seeking to address the country’s public debt burden, either by reducing the stock of debt or by making the servicing of that debt more manageable. There are currently growing calls by the G-20, International Financial Institutions, leading public figures, and the leading finance industry association—the Institute for International Finance—for both bilateral official sector and private creditors to consider offering debt relief to low-income and to some emerging market countries. These efforts may be necessary, but are also potentially painful, raising questions of inter-creditor equity, as well as whether the complexities of resolving disparate creditor interests, legal issues, and the likely time required to undertake those debt operations could delay much-needed emergency assistance.
Flexibility in assessing debt sustainability
IMF economists are experts; they are not clairvoyants. Given the breadth of possible outcomes over the coming months and years, the most realistic assessment of some countries seeking support would be to declare their debt sustainability prospects as uncertain. Lacking that option, in some instances, IMF staff are likely to feel pressure to predict shorter and shallower impacts of COVID-19 followed by faster and steeper recoveries, thus ensuring that the IMF can play its role as emergency lender of last resort, but finding debt sustainability where, in fact, the reality is more uncertain.
Finding debt sustainability across a wide swath of the developing world would allow the IMF to provide emergency support in a rapid time frame to countries in need. Doing so by potentially providing overly optimistic assessments of risks to individual countries, no matter how well intended, however, could weaken the integrity of its economic forecasts and analysis. This could ultimately make countries’ debts less—not more—sustainable, postpone necessary measures, more deeply subordinate investors, and increase the risks of a deeper, more destabilizing restructuring later, when the reality of inflated assumptions is revealed.
Including more flexibility in assessing debt sustainability in the IMF’s emergency lending instruments would allow the IMF to provide an honest and more realistic assessment of countries’ likely ability to emerge from the current (and any future) crisis and to allow officials, policymakers, creditors, and financial markets a more transparent assessment of countries’ economic health and prospects and to make their own decisions accordingly. It would provide for a more honest baseline for entering into negotiations with both official and commercial creditors, allowing them to consider playing a more constructive role in offering a standstill or other forms of debt relief, in the interests of avoiding nasty surprises later and increased subordination risk of the IMF that might be called to provide even more funds later.
Migrating away from the absolute need to find debt sustainability should not be done lightly. Doing so would require IMF member countries to affirmatively agree to accept greater risks to their capital. But IMF members should be willing to take on additional risk to their IMF contributions in order to serve the greater public good. This is a period of unprecedented global crisis that seems destined to impose significant and disproportionate humanitarian and economic damage to emerging markets and low-income countries in the weeks and months to come. The very nature of this health crisis demands an aggressive global response both out of a desire to do what is right and to avoid significant health and economic spillovers back to the U.S., China, the EU, Japan, and other major economies.
The IMF should continue to play a leading role in crisis response, and its staff should continue to assess the countries seeking support and provide their best assessments of the projects and risks of the debt burdens those countries are likely to face. And IMF members should be willing to acknowledge the unprecedented nature of the crisis and allow their funds to be deployed even when debt sustainability is uncertain. Everyone would be better off.

Executive Summary
Already today, the U.S. armed forces are providing important help here at home in the struggle against the novel coronavirus. Well over 10,000 members of the Army National Guard and Air Force National Guard have been mobilized to help with things like setting up more hospital capacity, transporting supplies, and providing other logistics. Other personnel, some retired, who have “Individual Ready Reserve” status are in some cases being activated when their particular skills in medicine or other crucial fields can help. They are typically doing so under what is called Title 32 of the U.S. code, whereby they are paid by the federal government but controlled by the governors of the individual states where they operate.

We need to prepare for a much larger, and more fraught, potential role for the American armed forces in this crisis as well. In short, they may need to backstop and backfill certain police forces. With 15% of the New York Police Department recently reporting sick due to COVID-19, self-quarantining measures, and other ailments — and even higher absentee rates reported in places like Detroit — hard-hit communities may soon need major assistance with tasks like patrolling streets, enforcing restrictions on movement, deterring crime, defusing situations of domestic violence, and sometimes arresting suspects. Such police work is legal for the National Guard, though not the active-duty military, under the 1878 Posse Comitatus law. And it may be the most prudent thing we can do to prevent a risk of deteriorating social stability and security conditions in a number of American cities in the spring and the hot, potentially very dangerous summer of 2020. Yet it is also highly fraught, and requires significant preparation — including for training Guard personnel quickly, and pairing them with police if and when they go on the beat. The warrior culture and warrior profession are much different than those of police officers.

Mandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY SportsCam Newton believes the Patriots can get the train back on the tracks but pinpointed the start of a “slippery slope” for New England as the arrival of the COVID-19 crisis in the team’s locker room.“Going back, and knowing this team as well as I do, coming off that Raiders win I think everyone had a full head of steam and momentum,” Newton told WEEI in Boston on Monday morning. “Then obviously what happened with COVID and everything like that, it’s just been a slippery slope, trying to regain your footing.”Newton said no one in the Patriots’ locker room is waving the white flag on the heels of Sunday’s loss to the Buffalo Bills. The defeat dropped the Patriots to 2-5 and into third place in the AFC East.New England has four losses in a row since beating the Las Vegas Raiders on Sept. 27. Six days later, and one day before the Patriots were scheduled to visit the Kansas City Chiefs, Newton tested positive for COVID-19. The next week, 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore tested positive.“This losing streak, it has affected everybody. But I don’t think nobody has consciously folded the tent and said, ‘I’m gonna give up.’ Because that’s not the case,” Newton said.Newton’s role as the starting quarterback became a public discussion point last week. He hasn’t thrown a TD pass since the win over the Raiders and has five interceptions in the past three games. A critical fumble on Sunday helped the Bills seal a 24-21 win.Newton’s two touchdown passes this season ranks 32nd in the NFL.“I’m putting in the time,” Newton said Monday, adding that players are staying after practice and remain dedicated to getting wins. “But for it not to transition into in-game success, that’s the most frustrating thing about the game of football. Because we’re all judged on ‘Did you win on Sunday? OK, why didn’t you win. It must have been something that you did on Thursday, Friday. You must have been out at the club or you must have been just breezing by.’ And it’s true, but it’s just hard to fathom that we play this game and so much hard work goes in vain when you don’t win.”New England’s next two games are in primetime: Week 9 against the winless New York Jets on Monday Night Football and Nov. 15 against the Baltimore Ravens (5-2).Field Level MediaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Addressing Congress in February 1990, Václav Havel captured the moment: “The human face of the world is changing so rapidly that none of the familiar political speedometers are adequate,” he said, describing a breathless disorientation when he added, “we have literally no time even to be astonished.”As the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating, history sometimes lurches away from the deeply familiar into an ill-formed “new normal.” But it also has a way of lingering, leaving elements of What-had-Been deeply interred – in the earth and the national psyche – to be rediscovered in the course of the Yet-to-Come.Consider the 1940 image above, warning of an unexploded German bomb found lying beneath London’s Fleet Street. Then consider that on January 12 two World War Two-era bombs were reported to have been discovered in Dortmund, Germany; another, in Venice, was reported on February 2 and just a day later, when yet another bomb was found under Dean Street in London’s Soho. History lurches, true, yet it also lingers...We are again living through a time of lurching, when “political speedometers” are insufficiently well calibrated to the pace of change. In the face of the current pandemic, and the economic dislocation it has occasioned, we must throw as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, at floundering businesses, entrepreneurs and sole proprietorships, gig economy workers and households in order to create conditions for a swift recovery. To do so, we will be forced to rely on the banking sector to play its critical intermediary role as perhaps never before.(For reference and graphic on the S&P 500 retreat into a bear market compared to past events recorded click:here)In support, bank regulators worldwide are putting a hold on the introduction of new regulations and delaying normal supervisory and oversight activities: the Basel Committee has pushed the deadline for implementing Basel III standards out by a year; the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is working to ease rules[here]; the UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority has cancelled its 2020 stress tests[here]; the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority has suspend much of its regulatory work through September and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has suspended its “close and continuous monitoring” program.In Asia, banks and regulators have benefitted by their experience confronting SARS in the early 2000s, and they have had longer to adjust to the pandemic. Today, banks across the region appear to be in a competition of sorts, aiming to burnish their credentials and social standing.Others must follow their example. Over a decade after the financial crisis, Banco Santander chair Ana Botín reminds, bankers remain distrusted around the world, contributing to current political populism[here]. The 2008 financial crisis originated in the banking sector – it was the banks that needed saving. But the subsequent “bailouts” bred a lingering resentment, and many still feel that banks first caused the crisis and then benefited at the taxpayer’s expense.Today’s trials reverse that dynamic: the current pandemic positions banks to reciprocate and to extend themselves on behalf of the taxpayers. But optimism here is unfortunately wanting.The years since the financial crisis have witnessed countless misconduct scandals, among banks in every major market across the globe. Despite enormous investment in governance, risk and compliance systems, processes and personnel, efforts to manage culture and conduct related risks in the financial sector in the last decade have proven demonstrably inadequate. Throwing more resources at past failed approaches is senseless – perhaps even irresponsible.Once our present crisis is past, we fear that we will learn of yet more industrywide misconduct, this time taking place as trillions of dollars were steered through the global banking system in order to support taxpayers. Assuredly, some firms will seize upon our current circumstances as a much-needed “redemption moment” for the industry[here]. But this will not insulate good actors from the inevitable social blowback that will result from the bad acts of even a relative few.In this time of lurching, we must pause to consider what may linger well into the future. Though supervisory scrutiny by regulators may be suspended, rather than viewing this as a “compliance holiday” of sorts, we believe that a doubling down on nonfinancial risk management should be an industry-wide priority. We cannot afford to allow a public health and economic crisis to become a moral crisis as well. History lingers. “If this epidemic results in greater disunity and mistrust among humans,” warns historian Yuval Noah Harari, “it will be the virus’s greatest victory.”[here]If we fail to address the financial sector’s Achilles Heel[bit.ly/2XBv0f9] – misconduct risk – in the course of what former International Monetary Fund Deputy Director Mohamed El-Erian has termed a race between economics and Covid-19[here], a spate of scandals will almost inevitably follow our current heroic efforts. This will rob the financial industry of what little public trust remains to it[here], likely deepening an already worryingly broad discontent with capitalism – and perhaps even with democracy itself.Policymakers, regulators, supervisors, boards and bank leadership and risk officers should consider this closely if they wish to avoid a future crisis, as pandemic-era bombs explode further on up the road.Stephen Scott, founder & CEO, Starling; Gary Cohn served as director of the National Economic Council from 2017-18, managing the U.S. regulatory reform and economic policy agenda.

Policymakers, educators, and community members often decry the large achievement and attainment gaps between English learner (EL) students and their English-proficient peers. Increasingly, attention is turning toward understanding not what’s going wrong among these students, but instead what’s going wrong with how schools educate, support, and empower these students. In the last few years, several studies have emerged documenting that simply being classified as an EL student in school can have a direct, negative impact on students’ test scores, graduation, and college-going. Possible explanations for these negative effects include that EL-classified students are often linguistically isolated with other EL students, tracked into low-level classes, and placed into classes with inexperienced teachers, all of which can harm a student’s outcomes.
New evidence on how EL classification affects teacher perceptions
An additional potential mechanism for how EL status may hurt students’ outcomes is through teacher perceptions and expectations. A long history of research has documented how teacher perceptions influence students’ achievement, and how teachers tend to have lower academic perceptions and educational expectations of marginalized student groups such as African-American and Latino students as well as girls in STEM.

In a new working paper, we assessed whether being classified as an EL student in school led teachers to have lower academic expectations of their students. We were able to take advantage of a unique policy characteristic in which states and districts use a range of different assessments and thresholds to determine who is classified as an English learner. As a result, students acquiring English with the same true English proficiency level and the same true academic skill levels are classified as ELs in some locales, but not in others. This process results in students who are, in effect, as-good-as-randomly assigned to EL or non-EL status based on their district or state of enrollment. This idiosyncrasy of EL identification policy allowed us to compare otherwise similar EL and non-EL students, estimating the causal effect of EL classification on teachers’ perceptions of students’ academic skill levels. Importantly, because we used a nationally representative dataset, our results are generalizable at the national level.
We focused on the EL classifications of incoming kindergarteners. That is, we compared teachers’ expectations over the next three years (kindergarten, first grade, and second grade) for ELs and non-ELs with similar characteristics as they entered kindergarten. In doing so, we looked across academic domains (English language arts, math, social studies, and science).
We found that EL classification resulted in teachers having lower academic expectations of their students. The effects were modest in size in kindergarten, but grew as students moved to first and second grades (reaching about a quarter of a standard deviation). Indeed, the direct effect of EL classification on teachers’ perceptions accounted for approximately half of the overall difference between how teachers perceived the academic skills of their EL and non-EL students.
We then investigated whether these effects were stronger in some settings than others. Specifically, in thinking about teachers’ perceptions of their EL-classified students, it is plausible that factors like the type of instructional program that a teacher works in may moderate the impact of EL classification on teacher perceptions. For example, a large body of research has found that bilingual instruction is beneficial for EL students. We posited that teachers working in bilingual instructional environments may have stronger connections to their students or enhanced ability to assess their EL students’ knowledge, thereby decreasing the likelihood that they hold biased expectations based on the EL label. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that teachers in bilingual settings do not have systematically different perceptions of their EL students compared to their non-EL multilingual peers.
Implications for policy and practice
This research adds to a growing recognition that being classified as EL alters how students are treated in school and the kinds of opportunities to which they have access. Some of the ways that EL classification impacts students are purposeful and beneficial (for example, targeted instruction toward English development) while others are unintended and harmful (such as exclusion from core content). The findings from this study demonstrate that EL classification also impacts teachers’ academic perceptions of their students. This points to some important implications for policy and practice.

First, high-stakes decisions for EL students that depend on teacher judgement–such as decisions about when to exit students from EL classification or in what classes to place students–are likely vulnerable to teacher bias. These types of decisions may best be made using established, objective criteria. Standardized assessments (that accurately assess EL students’ skills) and clear policies (that are fair and implemented in a standard way for all students) are good alternatives.
Second, interventions that attempt to decrease teacher bias may help teachers better understand and accurately assess their EL students’ skills and assets. Professional development such as that centered around increasing educators’ understanding of implicit bias and empathy toward marginalized students have been shown to decrease bias. Likewise, there is evidence that home visits can help teachers develop more positive perspectives about their students and families.
Finally, expanding bilingual instructional programs can allow more students to be in settings that minimize negative teacher bias. As noted earlier, bilingual education is academically and linguistically beneficial for EL students. Results from this study suggest that one mechanism that may explain some of the benefit of bilingual education is that, unlike in English instructional settings, educators in bilingual settings are not biased against their EL-classified students. Thus, expanding these programs–a pattern occurring in many states nationwide–may allow more students to benefit from unbiased instructional settings. While we do not know what it is about bilingual settings that minimizes bias, prior research demonstrates that EL students benefit when instructed by bilingual teachers, and that students of color benefit from having a teacher of their own racial/ethnic background. Thus, it is possible that in addition to increasing bilingual programs, hiring more bilingual teachers and teachers who share the same racial or ethnic background as their EL students could also minimize bias and improve EL students’ learning opportunities.

The lion’s share of the newest American immigrants do not speak English as a native language. The growing segment of children living in non-English-speaking households creates an increasing demand for teachers prepared to serve English learners. Unfortunately, state and federal policies and teacher preparation programs have not sufficiently prioritized training teachers for this growing segment of the student population, and teachers are, therefore, left unprepared in the classroom.
Let’s take a look at this population of English learners, and what states, teacher training programs, and the Department of Education are doing to promote better quality instruction for them.
Who are English learners?
English learners (ELs) is the most rapidly growing subgroup of public school students across the United States—the number of ELs grew by roughly 60 percent over the past decade. ELs currently account for nearly 10 percent of all students nationwide.
An important element of the EL label as used in schools is that it only applies to students still learning the language, and generally does not include those who have already successfully learned English from another foreign language. Including both former and current ELs more than doubles the proportion of public school students from non-English-speaking backgrounds. While many ELs are themselves immigrants, the majority of ELs are second-generation immigrants who are born in the United States and do not speak English as a first language at home.
In addition, EL students lag far behind their native English peers in school outcomes. The achievement gap between current EL and non-EL students in fourth-grade reading and in eighth-grade math is about 40 percentage points. In addition, EL students take fewer advanced courses than non-ELs, and only 59 percent of EL students graduate from high school in four years.
English learners in every classroom
Historically, ELs were largely separated from native English students with their own sheltered classrooms that prioritized English instruction, often at the expense of going light on other academic content. In recent decades, though, providing students instruction in mainstream classrooms has become more common. Moreover, researchers promote more integrated academic instruction as the preferred strategy to develop students’ English skills. This integrated instructional approach more closely resembles mainstream instruction and may plausibly result in more EL students making a transition between sheltered and mainstream classrooms sooner.

America faces a substitute teacher shortage—and disadvantaged schools are hit hardest

Jing Liu
Wednesday, October 21, 2020






In addition, the geographical spread of immigrants implies an increasingly diffuse population of ELs across schools. In recent decades, immigrants have begun to move beyond historical immigration gateways in major cities. They are now moving to traditionally white areas, including suburbs and rural areas, and as a result, more than half of all ELs in public schools are now outside of city centers.
These trends in both immigration settlement and the way English is taught to non-native speakers combine to imply most teachers, regardless of where they teach, will have a very good chance of encountering ELs during their careers. This creates the need that not only specialists but also general teachers are prepared to support ELs in the classroom.
Though the convergence of these trends make the need for teacher training more urgent, this is not something that should surprise us. At the turn of the 21st century, a national survey reported 41 percent of public school teachers in a variety of locales taught students with limited English proficiency. Fewer than a third of those teachers had even a modest level of training to support ELs. More recent surveys put the share of teachers with at least one EL over 55 percent, but we do not see any evidence that teacher training is improving.
A checkerboard of policies and programs
Research supports the notion that teachers trained and prepared to work with EL students can effectively support their students’ development. In New York City, English as a Second Language (ESL) certification for math teachers and pre-service teacher training focused on EL-specific instructional strategies predict greater math learning gains for ELs. Another study focuses on teacher quality in the Miami area, and finds having a good teacher in general is better for EL students than just finding an average EL specialized teacher; however, holding bilingual certification is differentially predictive of improving EL student achievement among all teachers. In other words, good teachers with EL training appears to be the optimal combination.
In spite of the growing need for both specialists and generalists trained in EL instruction, training EL-ready teachers has not been a priority for many teacher preparation programs. A 2014 report from the National Council on Teacher Quality shows that only 24 percent of programs train general elementary teacher candidates in strategies to support ELs or students not making progress in early reading. A 2016 study of practices in teacher preparation programs in six states with large Spanish-speaking populations also revealed a high degree of variation in EL teacher training across institutions. Thus, the level of preparation among new teachers to support ELs is uneven, at best.
Moreover, state policies on teacher training for both general education teachers and those specializing in ELs are a mixed bag. Many states do not require EL teachers or general classroom teachers to have an ESL, bilingual, Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) instructor, or one with a structured English immersion certification or endorsement. Experts in EL instruction strongly endorse teachers working closely with ELs to hold a bilingual or ESL certification. However, only 20 states explicitly require EL teachers to have an English Learners certification; and surprisingly, states such as Florida and Colorado that have more than 10 percent of students classified as EL do not explicitly require any type of EL certification for EL teachers. Furthermore, over 30 states do not require any type of EL training for general classroom teachers beyond that required by federal law.
Recent federal policies are raising the prominence of ELs. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires all schools to begin reporting EL students’ progress on both their English proficiency and core tested subjects, and substantially increases the funding targeted toward this group. Yet, no new federal policies have prioritized teacher training for ELs, either pre-service or in-service.
It is possible that ESSA’s new accountability requirements and flow of funds could encourage states to be more mindful of teacher quality for EL students. But despite the critical importance of training teachers to meet the needs of all students, including ELs, raising the bar for teacher training and professional development remains elusive across multiple levels of teacher training and school governance.

THE SITUATION
The nation’s economic and civic future depends on the success of its students who are “English Learners” (ELs), mostly immigrants and children of immigrants. English Learners, formerly known as “Limited English-Proficient (LEP) students,” have been recognized in federal law and policies since the 1960s. Attention to these students has moved from periphery to the center as their numbers have increased—about one in ten students are ELs and one in five come from homes where another language is spoken. They are also more widely distributed across the nation, with rapid growth in states not commonly considered points of immigrant entry such as Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Without appropriate educational supports, ELs are less likely than their peers to succeed in school and are more likely to drop out.
Download a PDF of this memo.
Historically, the classroom focus for these students has been on learning English, with ELs often pulled out of class for language instruction. This results in having less instructional time for other subjects. But academic learning (in mathematics, science, social studies, etc.) does not happen in isolation from language, nor does language development happen in an academic vacuum. Language development and academic learning occur in tandem. Thus, a key challenge in effectively educating ELs involves moving beyond language when defining their educational needs and potential.

The potential for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to drive improvement for ELs is best seen in the context of larger changes in assessment and accountability, as well as in specific provisions for ELs. ESSA represents the third phase of standards-based reform following the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994 and No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. ELs have been included in standards-based frameworks since the beginning, albeit largely via accessibility provisions in state academic assessments or the development of alternative assessments. NCLB introduced English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessments aligned to state ELP standards, and added a separate track of district accountability for ELP progress and attainment under Title III. This provision gave state directors of Title III programs a modicum of authority in working with their local agency counterparts in supporting districts identified for improvement.
ESSA significantly changes EL accountability. In addition to academic achievement in math, language arts, and science, the law now includes EL student progress toward English Language Proficiency as a central element of Title I accountability, thus “upgrading” the status of the ELP assessment within states. ELP standards and assessment are now integral to state ESSA accountability plans and subject to the same scrutiny as academic standards and assessment. For the first time in many states, directors of state accountability and Title I are seriously discussing the meaning and impact of English language proficiency, and state school chiefs, boards, and community organizations are beginning to take notice. As a result, Title III directors who are the internal advocates for these students within state education agencies are now more frequently at the table for state plan and accountability discussions. However, the longstanding bureaucratic and policy structure surrounding Title I (with a much larger appropriation) could pose institutional and program barriers to effectively integrating EL concerns into the Title I framework.
Principles for English Learners policy
To provide context for the recommendations that follow, we suggest two principles to guide policy, each of which would promote high-quality education for ELs:

First, we should support holistic learning of academic content along with English language, as opposed to a targeted focus on English language development to the exclusion or reduction of other subjects. Students are deprived of a richness of learning by keeping content separated from language. Consistent with learning theory, policy should integrate “academic content” and “English language” in the classroom. This will require policies that build systemic supports that include standards, assessment tasks/tools, accountability systems, curriculum/materials, professional development, leadership capacity, and research.
Second, we should move from a deficit to an asset model of bilingualism and help ELs to remain bilingual. This would recognize that bilingualism is a cultural, community, economic, and national security resource, with well-documented advantages both for the individual and society. The U.S. language policy has been a default model of immigrants rapidly shifting into monolingual English. The policy problem is that both the OCR/DOJ approach and ESEA/ESSA are oriented toward remedying deficits in English, not toward building on student cultural heritage and assets leading to more powerful learning, engaged citizenship, and national enrichment.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Develop policy that further promotes the integration of English learning and academic content in instruction, assessment, and accountability.

Cost: Low, if leveraging unproductive professional development costs now in place
Language and academic content learning are most effective when done in tandem; instruction, assessment, accountability, and support for educators need to take both into account without favoring one over the other. Under ESSA, local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs) have greater flexibility in how progress is coordinated and measured between English Language Proficiency and in academic achievement. We need to learn from the variation that is likely to result in order to ensure ELs’ full access to academic and elective content in school.
NCLB separated content from language by relegating language to Title III, which has lower priority within the eyes of the state and local systems of assessment. ESSA corrects this by placing English language proficiency as a significant element of the accountability requirements associated with the receipt of Title I. Doing so within the most visible section of federal law sends an important message that must become reflected in other parts of the system. The administration can give high priority to this shift and set up structures, activities, assessments, and capacity building that address this integration of language and content. Research to document best practices in state and local agencies can lead to systemic improvement in learning from these practices.
While federal law states that ELs must be provided full access to content, little has been done to uphold this right and considerable research shows that ELs are denied full access to both core academic content and elective content. Indeed, federal law has inadvertently created loopholes in this educational right by allowing for sequential provision of content (i.e., providing language instruction before content instruction) without delineating when, for whom, and for how long sequential provision of content is appropriate or acceptable. Law and regulation can require the monitoring of ELs’ access to content (something that is rarely done now) by, for example, requiring that EL participation in academic courses be included in Civil Rights data collection.

Transform Title III into a national language policy that promotes bilingualism and recognizes that bilingualism is an individual and societal asset.

Cost: Low, if using the bully pulpit to promote bilingualism
Bilingual education should be available to all students. Cognitive neuroscientists have discovered significant benefits of bilingualism, especially in areas of cognition known as “executive function,” which even seems to translate into significant delay in the onset of dementia in later life. The value of bilingualism is growingly recognized by business leaders and parents as well as students, who enroll in two-way immersion programs and aspire to the State Seal of Biliteracy, now recognized in 17 states.
The focus on the deficits of ELs has served to label and stigmatize them while taking attention away from the fact that bilingualism is a virtue and essential in this global economy. Bilingual education is a more direct and effective way for ELs to develop academic rigor rather than waiting for their English to develop in English-only programs.
Using its bully pulpit and regulatory authority, the Department of Education should work with other agencies including the State Department, HHS, Labor, Defense, Homeland Security, and others to recognize the value of bilingualism and how bilingualism serves the national interest. This could include the development of PSAs, social media, and student performance data to raise awareness of the advantages of bilingualism.

Require any new innovations to proceed only with consideration of ELs from the start, not as an afterthought. Provide incentives, guidance, and capacity building for states to fully include such opportunities for ELs in a proactive manner.

Cost: Moderate to high
Educational models are finally moving away from the “identify and punish” approaches to accountability that was the hallmark of NCLB. Instead, models are moving toward the philosophy of continuous improvement and local capacity development. As ESSA is implemented over the coming years, there is great opportunity for the federal agencies to lead. They can facilitate learning from different experiences in different states, and point to a better system that promotes continuous improvement and a growth mindset while serving the needs and learning outcomes of all students and maintaining a focus on ELs.
However, there is also great risk for ELs unless appropriate guardrails are in place to ensure their equitable and appropriate and meaningful inclusion. For example, ESSA allows “innovative assessment pilots” to take place in up to seven states, which creates an opportunity for meaningful inclusion of EL needs from the beginning. This includes ensuring that these innovative systems assess both content and English language proficiency. Moreover, the intentional inclusion of EL students in the design of “innovative” large-scale assessments must be extended to all 50 states to support both equity and excellence across all subgroups. The Department of Education should both require and provide incentives and guidance for states to include the assessment of English language proficiency as part of innovative assessment pilots. Such a requirement need not be just for EL students. A simple encouragement that such pilots include the assessment of how all students use language to learn and demonstrate their learning can make a huge difference for meeting the needs of EL students in these important educational innovations.
ESSA providing states with greater flexibility in accountability is another innovation that requires explicit attention to ELs. Examples include how weights are assigned to different indicators, how assessment items and tasks are designed to provide greater access, how long students who are exited ELs can remain in the EL subgroup, and the minimum N-size for the EL subgroup for reporting. State flexibility creates a condition of state-to-state variation from which lessons can be learned about system accountability and improvement. Such findings can inform the next reauthorization of ESEA by providing examples and patterns of effective policy. However, this development will require systematic data collection and analysis by the research community, led by the Institute of Education Sciences, with political support from stakeholders.

Expand the National Professional Development program within Title III to build national teacher capacity to support this work.

Cost: Moderate
None of the policies for language enrichment will work without teachers who have the capacity—working as individuals and as teams of teachers—to support the budding bilingualism of students. The National Professional Development program within Title III (targeted to teachers of ELs) should be significantly scaled up through increased funding for effective programs as part of a national effort addressed through Title II (for all teachers). This may include initiatives that address the shortage of qualified bilingual teachers by connecting programs in teacher education with K-12 schools, communities, and community organizations to recruit bilingual students into teaching careers. Online access for such initiatives would enable outreach to rural communities. These policies will tap into the vibrancy of American culture that represents the rich heritage of bilingualism, including its immigrant and native Indian history as well as diversity in the humanities and the arts.

Convene a policy summit and commission a policy brief for stakeholders to look at EL classification and definition procedures across states, and to move beyond the EL label to differentiate the needs of subgroups and individuals.

Cost: Low to moderate
ESSA requires states to develop standardized statewide entry and exit criteria for ELs, through broad consultation with LEAs and stakeholders. Implementation of this provision can be leveraged to create a national conversation about EL classification in order to better serve the individual needs of students. The EL classification masks enormous variation among individual students. One student may arrive as a teenage refugee from a war-torn country with little or no formal schooling but able to speak one or more other languages. Another may be born in the US to middle class immigrant parents. Another may migrate across states throughout the year as his or her parents do seasonal agricultural work. Yet another may have a learning disability that impacts both English and first language ability. These students have vastly different needs that can be lost by laws and regulations that treat all ELs as one monolithic group. The federal government can begin to move EL supports forward by creating systems that probe and respond to these individual needs, as is done for special education students under IDEA. The EL classification is the product of the Civil Rights movement, and with this history comes the idea of a protected class and accountable actions by local and state systems. It is time to carefully review the EL definitions and criteria for reclassification, and refine as appropriate to match the learning needs of the different kinds of students represented.
CONCLUSION
There are an estimated 5 million ELs in the US, in addition to an almost equal number of former ELs who have exited the status and are technically bilingual. These students have been painted into a picture of deficit and deprivation that does not fully recognize their assets, shared learning needs, or unrealized potential with all students. Supporting their educational opportunities should be grounded on the two principles upon which the recommendations are founded. First, we should support holistic learning of academic content along with the English language, as opposed to a targeted focus on English language development. And second, we should move from a deficit to an asset model of bilingualism and help ELs to remain bilingual. Policy initiatives consistent with these principles will catalyze the economic, civic, and cultural integration of this significant portion of our student population.

Not surprisingly, Houston also has one of the highest numbers of limited English proficient (LEP) residents of any metro in the nation, ranking 5th among large metropolitan areas. Over two-thirds of LEP residents in the region are in the workforce, but typically earn only about $25,000 a year. 
As Jill Wilson explains in her new paper, these workers, and their children, will account for almost all workforce growth in the coming decades, not just in Houston but in the nation as a whole. Realizing how much depends on the success of these families, public, philanthropic, private and civic actors are collaborating to expand access to English-language education, and thereby bolster earnings for families and create better outcomes for children. 
Neighborhood Centers, Inc., which Bruce Katz and I have written about previously, is helping LEP residents of the greater Houston region, including in suburbs where community self-perception and public services have not always caught up with demographic realities. Neighborhood Centers is one of the largest nonprofit service providers in the country, operating throughout the state of Texas, but its work is concentrated in community centers located throughout the sprawling Houston metropolis. One of those centers is in Pasadena, a once middle-class white suburb that now has a 20 percent poverty rate and is two-thirds Hispanic. 
In 2006, Neighborhood Centers uncovered a huge gap in Pasadena between demand for English language classes and their availability (something Wilson notes is common). According to Pasadena resident Roberta Leal, who I interviewed early last year for the book The Metropolitan Revolution, “Harris County [public school officials] were saying, ‘We have the capacity to host the classes, we just can’t get to the people.’ On the other hand, Neighborhood Centers is saying ‘We have the people, we need the resources, the instructors. Let’s meet in the middle, let’s make this happen.’” Today Neighborhood Centers coordinates a substantial adult education and English language program in Pasadena.  
This effort can provide tangible benefits to families and communities: Wilson’s paper documents an earnings premium of between 24 and 39 percent (depending on educational attainment) for English proficient workers versus LEP workers. “In some cases,” she notes, “better English proficiency is associated with more of a difference in earnings than is higher educational attainment.” 
But there are also benefits that defy easy quantification. Leal, whose mother learned English at a Neighborhood Centers program in Pasadena, then taught other LEP immigrants at the same community center, says that offering English language instruction sends a strong message to immigrants in particular. “It says we’re not upset that you came to this country and you don’t speak English. It says, we’re glad you came here, come to our home, we can teach you something new and get you out into the community to be your own leader.”

Recent education reform efforts commonly aim at improving teacher effectiveness. One study of three large districts finds that they spent approximately $18,000 for professional development for each teacher each year.1 Numerous education agencies, such as the District of Columbia Public Schools with its IMPACT effectiveness system for school-based personnel, and the state of Tennessee with its Tennessee Educator Acceleration Model, have invested substantial resources in teacher evaluation and feedback.2
These policies arose, at least in part, from the recognition that teachers affect not only student learning in the short-run, but also long-run outcomes such as college attendance and earnings as adults.3 A recent study following more than two million students estimated that having a teacher in grades four through eight with average effectiveness, instead of one who is among the five percent least effective, would increase a students’ lifetime income by more than $250,000. Teachers also affect the likelihood that a student attends any college, attends a higher-ranked college, does not have children as a teenager, and saves more for retirement.4
Most of the researchers examining the effects of teachers on student test performance have concluded that math teachers have a greater effect on students’ performance on math exams than English language arts teachers have on students’ performance on English exams.5 For example, studies in North Carolina and New York City found that math teachers had approximately a 35 percent greater impact on test scores in their field than did English teachers.6
Nonetheless, the research on the long-term effects of teachers finds that English teachers have at least as much of an effect as math teachers. For example, that same study following 2.5 million students found that an English teacher who raises students’ reading test scores by the same amount as a math teacher raises students’ math test scores has an impact on long-term life outcomes approximately 1.7 times that of the math teacher. Even though, on average, English teachers don’t increase English language arts test scores as much as math teachers increase math scores, English teachers have as strong an effect on students’ later lives.

A forthcoming study using data from urban areas in two states sheds light on why English teachers have these strong effects even though their effects on current year test scores are not as strong.7 The benefits of good English teachers are seen in students’ achievement in future years, not only in English, but in other subjects as well. The study distinguishes the persistent effects that teachers have in their own subject—English teachers on students’ later English test performance and math teachers on students’ later math test performance—from cross-subject effects in which English teachers in one year can affect math performance in subsequent years and math teachers in one year can affect math performance in a subsequent year. While the effects that math and English teachers have on students’ test scores in the year that they have them similarly persists in their own subject in subsequent years, the gains in English scores due to English teachers have far greater effects on students’ subsequent math performance than the gains in math scores due to math teachers have on students’ subsequent English performance.
In fact, in some cases students’ math achievement in sixth grade due to having an above average English teacher in fifth grade is almost as great as that due to having an equally above average math teacher in fifth grade. In contrast, while having an above average English teacher in fifth grade meaningfully affects students’ sixth grade English test performance, having a similarly above average math teacher in fifth grade has essentially no effect on English test performance. Data from New York City show that English teachers’ persistent effect on math is 70 percent of their persistence effect on English, while math teachers’ persistent effect on English is less than 5 percent of their persistent effect on math (see the following figure). Similarly, English teachers in Miami-Dade County Public Schools demonstrate a persistent effect on math that is 46 percent as large as their effect on English, while math teachers in the district have a persistent effect on English that is less than five percent as large as their persistent effect on math.

English teachers affect later student success across fields, while math teachers appear to only affect math performance. This pattern holds in both states studied, states with quite different state tests.
Why might the effects of good English teachers spill over into math learning, while the effects of good math teachers do not? One possibility is that the English curriculum might build capacities that are relevant for math learning. Reading skills and other linguistic skills, for example, might be key to understanding word problems on math exams. Similarly, English language arts teachers might promote the ability to think logically and organize complex materials, which, in turn, benefits math performance. An alternative explanation is that English teachers are able to motivate students, perhaps through drawing connections between the books they read and students’ experiences, in ways that math teachers do not. A study using data on ninth grade students in North Carolina schools found that teachers can affect students in ways not reflected by test scores, such as whether they come to school (attendance) or complete the work necessary to progress to the next grade. Teachers who are good at improving these non-test-based outcomes for students also positively affect their students longer run outcomes such as graduation and college and career aspirations.8 That study shows that accounting for these effects that teachers can have on students is key to understanding English teacher effectiveness on students’ long-run outcomes, but far less important for understand math teachers’ effects. That is, good English teachers—those with the greatest long-run effect on students—affect not only test performance in English but also behaviors such as skipping school.
The large research base on teachers’ value-added to student test performance has consistently found that which math teacher a student has matters a lot for their learning during the year in that math teacher’s class and that the learning sticks with students in subsequent years. The findings for the importance of English teachers on English test performance have been clear but less strong. However, the research linking teachers to students long-run outcomes has found that English teachers are as important as math teachers. We are beginning to see the reasons for this. English teachers have important effects that go far beyond test performance and affect not only behaviors such as attendance and successful course completion but also test performance in other subject areas such as math.
Although the focus here is on teachers’ contributions to student learning, the findings may also have broader implications for other interventions that aim to develop students’ skills in reading and language arts. The results suggest that observed gains on English language arts assessments in the year of instruction do not fully capture the benefits that students are accruing from high quality English language arts instruction. The capacities that students are developing in their English classes—whether these be skills in logic or organization or the motivation they need to excel in school—are advancing their math learning almost as much as their learning in math class. Understanding what good English teachers are doing well may be just what we need to improve math outcomes for students.

Those watching election results recently know voter demographics, and how they’ve changed over time, play a major role during primary campaign season. These national demographic trends not only influence presidential campaigns but also affect schools across the country. Today 10 percent of all students attending public schools in the US are classified as English Language Learners (ELLs)—the number of students with this classification has increased by 14 percent over the past decade. A priority for all public schools with ELL students is to help them achieve proficiency in English, commonly known as “exiting” ELL status or “reclassifying.”  In research forthcoming in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management we use data from Wisconsin to examine how reclassifying an ELL student as fully English proficient during his or her high school years affects important subsequent outcomes.
ELL students are a heterogeneous population, varying from young children of immigrants born in the US to refugees arriving in the country during their adolescence. The policies and practices surrounding the education of ELLs are likewise wide-ranging and diverse. Within broad federal requirements laid out in Title III of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), states are given substantial latitude in determining the process and criteria for reclassifying ELLs. 
As in many other states, reclassification decisions in Wisconsin rely heavily on students’ performance on the state’s English proficiency assessment—the Assessing Comprehension and Communication in English State-to-State (ACCESS) exam. Students scoring above the proficiency threshold on the ACCESS exam are automatically reclassified as fully English proficient. District personnel can also manually reclassify students scoring just below the proficiency threshold as fully English proficient, but evidence suggests that manual reclassifications are relatively rare in Wisconsin.
The impact of reclassification as a fully English proficient student
Reclassifying a student as fully English proficient changes several aspects of students’ educational environment. At the high school level, reclassification has the potential to put students on an educational track that has access to resources that better prepare them for postsecondary education. On the other hand, exiting ELL status often eliminates access to instructional accommodations and supports tailored to promote these students’ success.
In our research we examine this by estimating the effect of reclassification that occurs prior to a student’s 11th grade year on his or her ACT scores, likelihood of high school graduation, and postsecondary enrollment. We focus on reclassification occurring prior to 11th grade because junior year is typically when postsecondary preparation begins in earnest—students generally take the ACT in 11th grade and high schools typically first offer postsecondary counseling at this time. The postsecondary preparation experiences of students classified as ELLs may differ significantly from those of students who have been reclassified as fully English proficient.
We estimate the effect of reclassification by taking advantage of Wisconsin’s policy that automatically reclassifies students who score above the proficiency threshold on the ACCESS exam. In particular, we compare the outcomes of students who score just above the proficiency threshold—most of whom are reclassified as fully proficient—to the outcomes of their peers who fall just short and are likely to remain classified as ELLs in 11th grade.  This design allows us to make causal claims about the impact of being reclassified by the beginning of 11th grade for those students who scored near the proficiency threshold on the ACCESS. 
For these students, we find that reclassification increases students’ composite ACT score by about one full point. Most of this increase is attributable to improved performance on the English and reading portions of the ACT. Our results also indicate that reclassification increases postsecondary enrollment in the fall after high school graduation, with the increase largely due to increased enrollment at four-year institutions.
We theorize that the positive effects of scoring above the automatic reclassification threshold are attributable to students being exposed to different college preparation activities and resources than their peers who scored just below the cutoff and remain classified as ELLs—ACT preparation, college counseling, and assistance with the application or financial aid process are potential examples. Although our research provides indirect evidence in support of this explanation, we acknowledge that we do not know the mechanisms responsible for producing the effects we find. For example, it could be the case that reclassification serves as a motivator for students and give them a positive view of the schooling environment. We hope additional research will provide further insight into the mechanisms through which reclassification during a students’ high school years affects the outcomes we study.
Policy implications for governing the education of ELLs
Our results have important implications for policy governing the education of ELLs. At a basic level, our results indicate the importance of a student’s ELL classification at the beginning of his or her junior year, at least for Wisconsin students scoring near the English proficiency threshold on the ACCESS exam. This suggests that schools and districts should ensure that students scoring just below the English proficiency threshold have access to the same postsecondary preparation activities and resources as students scoring just above the cutoff. Additionally, schools and districts may wish to more closely consider whether to manually reclassify students scoring just below the ACCESS proficiency threshold—currently, less than 25 percent of students who score just below the cutoff are manually reclassified as fully proficient. However, under current policy, schools that aggressively reclassify students will find that the decreased ELL enrollment size results in reduced funding for their ELL program.

More generally, our research suggests policymakers face a complex set of considerations when designing the accountability systems for ELL student performance that are required by ESSA. Indeed, these systems should strive to encourage both achievement of English proficiency and mastery of academic content while ensuring that students’ options in other domains, such as postsecondary education or extracurricular activities, remain unaffected by the incentives that schools and districts face with respect to reclassification. And all of this must be done while incorporating the uniformity in identification, entrance, and exit procedures for ELL classification that ESSA requires.
Our research does not point to a single resolution to this challenge, particularly given the substantial variation in both the ELL population and in the design and quality of programs that serve these students. However, it does point to the fact that getting the design of these systems right is incredibly important. Doing so has the potential to improve the outcomes of a large (and ever-growing) number of students.

321,https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/scotland-independence-english-cities-and-the-state-of-american-federalism/,"Scotland Independence, English Cities and the State of American Federalism","


As Scotland prepares to vote on independence this week, it is easy to dismiss the upheaval “across the pond” as irrelevant to American political institutions and arrangements. Despite our nation’s deep partisan divide and the occasional wild secession talk of demagogic politicians in Texas and elsewhere, an American state leaving the union is not even a remote possibility. Yet the Scottish vote—and, more importantly, the broader devolution debate underway in Britain—does have timely lessons for the United States. 
 
First, some background: The underlying issue in Britain is about power and how it is distributed across multiple layers of government and society. Britain is one of the most famously centralized nations in the world. Whitehall, the seat of national government in London, collects almost all of the tax revenue in the country and then enforces a heady mix of tax, spending and regulatory programs and policies. Government agencies tinker and meddle on issues that are routinely left to states, provinces or cities in other countries. 
 
The extent of central control is such that Ken Livingstone, former MP and London’s first mayor, once famously characterized Britain’s political culture as the equivalent of “East Germany at the height of the Cold War, with a required election every four or five years that is more or less democratic.”
 
Bob Kiley, an American who ran the London Transport system during the mid-1990s, disagreed. “North Korea is a better example,” he said.
 
In the past fifteen years, Whitehall’s iron grip on power has slowly begun to loosen. Since the late 1990s, powers have been partially devolved to Scotland and Wales. London now has a directly elected mayor (as do other large cities like Bristol and Liverpool) with powers over transportation, economic development and planning. More recently, “metro deals” have been struck between central government and major British city regions like Greater Manchester, enabling greater flexibility and sparking collaboration across jurisdictional lines. 
 
The demand for more devolution to major cities now dominates British politics. Two widely respected political figures—Lord Michael Heseltine, a former Tory deputy prime minister and Lord Andrew Adonis, a former Labour minister for transportation—have issued major treatises on the topic in the past few years. The City Growth Commission created by the Royal Society of Arts a year ago (and chaired by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill) is poised to issue a major report this fall. Well-respected think tanks like the Centre for Cities, Centre for London, Policy Network and IPPR North are now weighing in with sensible reform proposals and concrete initiatives.

All these efforts embrace Lord Heseltine’s devolutionist credo, “Local leaders are best placed to understand the opportunities and obstacles to growth in their own communities.” More broadly, these efforts recognize the outsized role that major cities and their metropolitan areas play in the British economy and position devolution as a vehicle for advancing core national objectives like restructuring the economy, creating jobs and enhancing social mobility. As Lord Adonis has written, “We have got to see prosperity shared more widely, and it can only be shared more widely if we have strong powerful economic and political institutions at the local level able to deal with these fundamental problems of skills and infrastructure.”
 
Does the British devolution debate apply to the United States? The starting points are obviously different in important ways. As a federal republic, power is already shared between the federal government and the states. And the level of fiscal and other powers enjoyed by cities and metropolitan areas far outweighs those that exist in Britain and most other nations. 
 
Dig a little deeper, however, and it is clear that American federalism is in a deep state of crisis and in serious need of repair.

Our cities and metropolitan areas—and the networks of public, private and civic institutions and leaders who co-govern them and co-finance growth—are increasingly grappling on their own with super-sized challenges that range from population growth and demographic transformation to urgent economic, social and environmental demands. By conservative estimates, they will need to invest trillions of dollars in the next decade in key areas like infrastructure, housing and education to stay competitive in the global economy. With Washington mired in partisan rancor and many states adrift or hostile, responsibility is falling to cities and metro areas to get the job done. This trend will only accelerate as federal and state governments face new fiscal constraints due to the aging of our society and related pension and health costs. 
 
Like Britain, the United States needs a “decentralization decade” (a term coined by an IPPR North report) to unleash the latent potential for investment in cities and metropolitan areas and power the nation forward. Three things are critical. 
 
First, the federal government and states should lead where they must and make the kinds of nation strengthening investments that cities and metropolitan areas are simply not equipped to make. Investments in the safety net to ensure that disadvantaged individuals, old and young alike, have the wherewithal to live lives of dignity and promise. Investments in basic science and applied research and development to recapture America’s historic lead in innovation. Investments in infrastructure to further link metropolitan economies and knit the nation together, maximizing the prosperity of our common market. The funding to make these kinds of smart and strategic investments is available but only if our higher levels of government “cut to invest” and re-allocate hundreds of billions of dollars a year away from consumption-oriented activity (e.g., the federal mortgage interest deduction, wasteful state economic development subsidies) and towards productive, innovative activities. 
 
Second, the federal government and states should give local and metropolitan actors better tools and greater flexibility to make decisions that meet their unique challenges, particularly in the face of budget cuts. Boston and San Francisco, for example, should be allowed to find new ways to finance public and affordable housing or determine their own priorities for federal skills or infrastructure funding rather than adhere to rigid rules and prescriptions made in Washington. New York City shouldn’t have to beg the New York State legislature to enact congestion pricing or raise local revenues to fund pre-K education—a feudal “may I?” system that is the rule rather than the exception in state after state. More powers, in short, should be nested and vested at the local and metropolitan level and new forms of innovative financing mechanisms should be tested to attract a robust mix of public, private and civic capital. 
 
Finally, the federal government and the states should encourage collaboration between cities and their suburbs rather than rewarding competition between them. As the turmoil in Ferguson, Mo. reminded us, a multitude of small, balkanized municipal governments dot the governing landscape of most metropolitan areas, making problem solving difficult on the vast array of issues that naturally cross borders. We need a burst of experimentation to better align the geography of governance with the way our natural and economic ecosystems actually work. Perhaps the federal government and states could negotiate their own “metro deals” with cities and their suburbs on issues like housing, infrastructure, skills training, environment and economic development. Perhaps states and urban counties could create new public/private institutions to design and implement economic development strategies that drive productive and innovative growth and lessen competition between “little box” governments. 
 
The United States, in short, needs to think again about federalism, and remake it in a way that accounts for the economic power, networked structure and irreducible diversity of America’s cities and metros. If the 20th century rewarded the hierarchical, bureaucratic nation-state, the 21st century demands federated republics that not only rebalance power between different levels of government but across different sectors of society. As in Scotland and Britain, this will require higher levels of government to trust the nation and its limitless potential for pragmatic, affirmative innovation and give up power to advance national prosperity and innovation.

Findings
An analysis of the labor market characteristics of the working-age limited English proficient (LEP) population in the United States and its largest metropolitan areas reveals that:

Nearly one in 10 working-age U.S. adults—19.2 million persons aged 16 to 64—is considered limited English proficient. Two-thirds of this population speaks Spanish, but speakers of Asian and Pacific Island languages are most likely to be LEP. The vast majority of working-age LEP adults are immigrants, and those who entered the United States more recently are more likely to be LEP.
Working-age LEP adults earn 25 to 40 percent less than their English proficient counterparts. While less educated overall than English proficient adults, most LEP adults have a high school diploma, and 15 percent hold a college degree. LEP workers concentrate in low-paying jobs and different industries than other workers.
Most LEP adults reside in large metropolitan areas, but their numbers are growing fastest in smaller metro areas. Eighty-two percent of the working-age LEP population lives in 89 large metropolitan areas, and 10 metro areas account for half of this population. Large immigrant gateways and agricultural/border metro areas in California and Texas have the largest LEP shares of their working-age populations. Smaller metro areas such as Cape Coral, Indianapolis, and Omaha experienced the fastest growth in LEP population between 2000 and 2012. Los Angeles was the only metro area to experience a decline.
Educational attainment and the native languages of LEP adults vary considerably across metro areas. The share who have completed high school ranges from 33 percent in Bakersfield to 85 percent in Jacksonville. Spanish is the most commonly spoken non-English language among LEP adults in 81 of the 89 large metro areas, but the share varies from a low of 5 percent in Honolulu to 99 percent in McAllen.
Most working-age LEP people are in the labor force. A majority across all 89 large metro areas is working or looking for work, and in 19 metro areas, at least 70 percent are employed. Workers proficient in English earn anywhere from 17 percent to 135 percent more than LEP workers depending on their metro location.

English proficiency is an essential gateway to economic opportunity for immigrant workers in the United States. Yet access to acquiring these skills is persistently limited by a lack of resources and attention. Increasing investment in adult English instruction—through more funding, targeted outreach, and instructional innovations—would enhance the human capital of immigrants that could lead to more productive work and better outcomes for their children. Given the large number of LEP workers in the United States and the fact that virtually all of the growth in the U.S. labor force over the next four decades is projected to come from immigrants and their children, it is in our collective interest to tackle this challenge head on.

Cameroon’s government shuts down internet in the country’s English-speaking region
Two weeks ago, protests escalated when the Cameroonian government ordered the shutdown of the internet in Anglophone Cameroon, prompting the hashtag #BringBackOurInternet. The region—historically marginalized and discriminated against—has been without internet since then. The outage has been detrimental to the region’s local economy. Banks are paralyzed and salaries have gone unpaid, as companies are unable to access their bank accounts. ATM services have been suspended. Reporters have been compelled to communicate information to their head offices via SMS. In addition, journalists have been asked to not report on the conflict, under the threat of revocation of their media license. The government states that the shutdown was necessary in order to “preserve peace” during this time of protests.

The tension goes back to the country’s independence in 1960, when the part of Cameroon colonized by the French merged with the part controlled by the British to form one country. Now, Cameroon’s Anglophone population makes up a fifth of Cameroon’s 22 million people. Presently, the official languages of the two regions remained the ones they had during colonization. However, this situation now poses a problem as the minority English speakers often face discrimination and are unable to hold civil service jobs, as the government often publishes documents in French, despite having English as one of the official languages. Last November, 100 people were arrested after days of protests against the use of the French language in courts and schools in Anglophone parts of Cameroon. Lawyers from the region opposed the employment of court workers who lack an understanding of British common law: The courts in the Francophone administrative regions use French civil law.  
In the last couple of week, opposition leaders have been arrested and several activists have been placed in jail while lobbying for human rights in Anglophone Cameroon. This week, fear mounted as the trials of protestors were postponed, without the provision of an explanation.
African Union summit elects a new AU Commission chairperson and makes historic decisions
The 28th African Union (AU) Summit concluded earlier this week with a number of major announcements and a new AU Commission chairperson. On Monday, Morocco, which left the organization’s predecessor 33 years ago, was re-admitted to the AU by a vote of 39 of the 53 countries. Though praise for a unified Africa has dominated much of the coverage, not all leaders (such as those in Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana) agreed with the decision. Indeed, Zimbabwe’s President Mugabe has strongly criticized the decision. Morocco had left the AU over the union’s admittance of Western Sahara, of which Morocco controversially claims ownership. However, facing a changing Europe and a shifting global trade regime, the North African country is turning towards its African neighbors as intra-African trade continues to grow. Experts state that a second reason for Morocco’s return is that its membership in the AU gives it “legitimacy” in its attempts to resolve the dispute over Western Sahara.
In addition to admitting Morocco, the AU also adopted a strategy for a “mass withdrawal” from the International Criminal Court (ICC) during the summit. A frequently contentious issue, South Africa and Burundi[1] are already pulling out of the ICC, and other countries, such as Kenya, have been considering it, often citing racism, colonialism, and political interference by the court. However, the strategy was passed with “many reservations,” it is non-binding, no communique has been issued, the strategy has no timeline, and it maintains “few concrete recommendations for action.” Indeed, in the recent past many countries have expressed support for the ICC, including Nigeria and Senegal along with many others.
Also during the summit, Chadian Foreign Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat was elected AU Commission chairperson. For more on the candidates, see last week’s Africa in the news. For an in-depth analysis on the vote, see AGI Nonresident Fellow John Mukum Mbaku’s extensive look at the July candidates as well as the complex politics and repercussions of the July outcome.

Tuesday, January 31, marked the first day of a three-day mass protest organized by business owners and merchants in Monrovia, Liberia who are calling on the government to address growing economic challenges, including mounting inflation, the depreciation of the Liberian dollar against the U.S. dollar, high tariffs and incidental taxes, and police harassment of petty traders. The protestors shut down their businesses to draw attention to their cause and marched on the capitol. There, they entreated legislators to consider the effects of the Liberian dollar’s depreciation and high tariffs on imported goods and the burden they pose for entrepreneurs. Lawmakers acknowledged their concerns, and House Speaker J. Emmanuel Nuquay sought to reassure the protestors, stating, “Both chambers of the legislature together with the Justice Ministry and the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) have already begun series of meetings aimed at addressing this situation.”
Meanwhile, last week President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made her final annual address to lawmakers before the country holds general elections in October 2017. During her speech, Sirleaf similarly enumerated the economy’s woes, explaining that falling commodity prices and the 2014 Ebola outbreak reduced government revenues in recent years, and coupled with declining foreign aid, could lead to severe spending cuts to keep public debt from rising. Despite averaging economic growth rates of 8 percent between 2006 and 2013, the IMF expects that Liberia’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 2016 and will rebound slightly by 3.2 percent in 2017.

Workers in the United States without full proficiency in English are found in a variety of occupations and industries, represent a wide swath of origin countries and cultures, and have varying levels of income. As Jill Wilson, a senior research analyst and associate fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program, finds in her new report on English skills, English proficiency is a strong predictor of economic standing among immigrants regardless of educational attainment. “National, state, and regional leaders,” Wilson argues, “have an opportunity to enhance the human capital and economic mobility of their current and future workforce by investing in adult English instruction through more funding, targeted outreach, and innovative instruction.”

The Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), authorized by the CARES Act, provides loans to small and mid-size firms and large below-investment-grade firms that were financially sound before the onset of the pandemic. Extending credit can help some of these businesses manage the near-term drop in revenues, prevent unnecessary failures, and so support a recovery once the pandemic eases. The MSLP is a big step for the Federal Reserve and Treasury, given the risk of these loans and the legal constraints on Fed lending.
Domestic borrowers with fewer than 15,000 employees and less than $5 billion in 2019 revenues are eligible to apply; they account for a significant share of aggregate employment.  Loans will be made by banks, who will retain 5 percent of the loan and sell the remaining 95 percent to one of three Main Street facilities. All Main Street loans have a five-year maturity, defer interest payments for one year, defer principal payments for two years, and have a loan rate of LIBOR plus 3 percentage points. Borrowers have limits on executive compensation, shareholder distributions, and employment.
The program has been revised twice in response to feedback. Still there are features that may limit take-up. We believe the current program would be more attractive and, thus, more effective if loan terms were more tailored to the characteristics of borrowers, the rigidity of fixed debt repayments was reduced, and lenders received more compensation for taking additional risks. We recommend the following:

Loans to borrowers with higher credit quality should have a lower spread than loans to more-leveraged borrowers.
Loans should have maturities of more than 5 years and more delayed repayments, but incentives for firms to repay earlier should be added.
The minimum loan size for the New Loan facility should be reduced to reach smaller borrowers and encourage smaller banks to participate in the program. Loans to smaller and less risky borrowers also should have lower spreads and streamlined paperwork requirements.
Banks should be allowed to extend loans to riskier borrowers if they retain a larger share of the loan to demonstrate their confidence in the credit.
The condition that the borrower make “commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its payroll and retain its employees” should be clarified, so that uncertainty about it does not limit take-up, or eliminated altogether to make it easier for borrowing firms to reorganize their businesses.
Compensation to banks should be increased to encourage their participation given the risk that new loans will be correlated with risks of existing loans, and to encourage more efficient loan workouts if there is a high level of delinquencies.

These changes would pose additional risk to the $75 billion that the Treasury has provided to cover any losses. However, it is critical to support businesses now. The downturn is very deep, and the risk of permanent harm to labor markets because of protracted high unemployment is large. Thus, the Fed and the Treasury should move quickly to adjust the terms of the program if take-up is low. Even with the recommended changes, however, the program may have limited demand because many businesses need equity, not more credit. Congress should be prepared consider other types of programs, such as loan guarantees or insurance, which, combined with lending, would promote a more rapid recovery in employment and limit long-run damage to the economy.

The year 2015 was a big one for global development policy debates, marking the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the launch of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the “Global Goals.” But how much did major media pay attention? 
Last September, Christine Zhang and I published a working paper that examined mentions of the MDGs across major English-language press and academic outlets from 2000 through 2014. We blogged highlights from the original paper here.  
More recently, we updated some of the results to account for last year’s major MDG-SDG debates and events. Figure 1 adds 2015 newspaper data on the MDGs and also includes SDG mentions over the entire time period.

Part II of the 2015 Brown Center Report on American Education


Over the next several years, policy analysts will evaluate the impact of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) on U.S. education.  The task promises to be challenging.  The question most analysts will focus on is whether the CCSS is good or bad policy.  This section of the Brown Center Report (BCR) tackles a set of seemingly innocuous questions compared to the hot-button question of whether Common Core is wise or foolish.  The questions all have to do with when Common Core actually started, or more precisely, when the Common Core started having an effect on student learning.  And if it hasn’t yet had an effect, how will we know that CCSS has started to influence student achievement?  
The analysis below probes this issue empirically, hopefully persuading readers that deciding when a policy begins is elemental to evaluating its effects.  The question of a policy’s starting point is not always easy to answer.  Yet the answer has consequences.  You can’t figure out whether a policy worked or not unless you know when it began.[i]  
The analysis uses surveys of state implementation to model different CCSS starting points for states and produces a second early report card on how CCSS is doing.  The first report card, focusing on math, was presented in last year’s BCR.  The current study updates state implementation ratings that were presented in that report and extends the analysis to achievement in reading.  The goal is not only to estimate CCSS’s early impact, but also to lay out a fair approach for establishing when the Common Core’s impact began—and to do it now before data are generated that either critics or supporters can use to bolster their arguments.  The experience of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) illustrates this necessity.

Much has recently been written about the growing problem of teacher shortages. While such shortages may sometimes result from, or lead to, high rates of teacher turnover at the school level, turnover—defined as the yearly rate of departure of teachers from a school—is of policy interest in its own right. It imposes financial costs on schools and districts because of the need to find replacement teachers, and it has been shown to reduce student achievement.
Here we highlight a concern related to the within-school turnover of middle school teachers, namely the disruption of teacher staffing in core subjects. We draw on a recent paper in which we examined how middle schools in North Carolina responded to changes in the rates of turnover of their math and English language arts (ELA) teachers in grades six, seven, and eight from 1998 to 2016.

Turnover is inherently disruptive
Within a middle school, the teachers of a single subject area are likely to teach similar types of material, may work together to offer a coherent curriculum, and, to some extent, may be interchangeable. Regardless of whether a teacher leaves one school to move to another school or quits the profession, the departure of one is likely to affect the others. We focus on middle school teachers because comparable groups of teachers would be difficult to identify at the elementary school where self-contained and multi-subject classrooms are more common, or at the high school level where subjects often become highly specialized. The middle school subjects of math and ELA are also student tested subjects, and therefore directly affect a school’s accountability rating.
When teachers leave a school, one option for the school is not to replace them and to opt instead to raise class sizes. Alternatively, the school may replace departing teachers with other teachers who have either weaker or stronger qualifications, or it might switch teachers across subjects. In contrast to much of the earlier research on teacher mobility, our approach allows us to examine the net effects of teacher turnover on the mix of teachers in a school, where net effects take into account both the qualifications of the teachers who leave and the qualifications of those who replace them.
Turnover rates and pattern over time
We are interested in responses to teacher turnover by school, subject, and year. The figure shows that turnover rates (as measured by three-year averages of math and ELA teachers in middle schools) exhibited substantial variation in North Carolina over our 18-year time period and are currently high.

Starting at about 23% in 1998, the rate rose reasonably steady to nearly 28% in 2008, before dropping precipitously during the recession. The recession-induced drop is not surprising given that teaching jobs may be preferable to outside options during a period of rising unemployment. But the turnover rate then increased from its nadir in 2012 to 29% in 2016, the final year of our sample.
Our empirical strategy was straightforward: Our goal was to estimate how changes in a school’s turnover rate affect the mix of teachers or class sizes in the following year, controlling statistically for other factors that might affect the outcomes (including school or school-by-year fixed effects). Our outcome variables are the percentages of teachers with three or fewer years of experience, with lateral or provisional licenses, or who are teaching out of subject; average teacher licensing exam scores; and average class sizes. We chose the four teacher characteristics because studies show they are predictive of student achievement. The class size measure allowed us to determine if schools responded to teacher turnover by raising class sizes, a change that could also be detrimental to student outcomes.
The evidence is clear that higher teacher turnover leads to higher proportions of teachers with limited experience, lateral entry teachers, or those with provisional licenses. The increased reliance on lateral entry teachers or those with provisional licenses was particularly evident among schools with large concentrations of low-performing students or high rates of poverty. We found no differential responses across urban and rural schools, or schools categorized by their geographic distances to the nearest teacher education program.

7 findings that illustrate racial disparities in education

Liz Sablich
Monday, June 6, 2016






Somewhat less consistent evidence suggests that schools also respond by hiring teachers with lower licensure scores or by increasing the proportions of teachers teaching out of subject. We find essentially no evidence that middle school administrators in North Carolina respond to teacher turnover in their schools by increasing class sizes. That is not surprising given that math and ELA are core subjects with state end-of-grade tests and that the state has maximum course size regulations.
Importance and policy implications
Our empirical findings highlight three potential mechanisms through which high rates of teacher turnover may adversely affect the joint capacity of teachers within a middle school. First, the resulting higher proportions of teachers with weak qualifications are likely to reduce the quality of teaching, and, as shown in prior studies, to reduce student achievement. Second, the influx of new and inexperienced teachers is likely to be disruptive and could interfere with the development of a coherent curriculum. Lastly, the compositional change is likely to increase turnover in subsequent years because of the greater proclivity of novice teachers and alternatively certified teachers to leave schools.
The potential for higher subsequent turnover strengthens the case for policymakers to address directly the challenges posed by high teacher turnover rather than focusing only on longer-term strategies designed to improve the quality of the overall teacher labor force. One strategy for reducing the probability of high rates of teacher turnover is to improve school working conditions by raising the quality of a school’s leadership or providing differential pay for teachers to remain in hard-to-staff schools or subjects. A complementary strategy would be to adopt policies designed to make schools more resilient to the loss of teachers, like enhancing the teacher pipeline for such schools and providing strong mentorship programs for early career teachers. While those policies might also help reduce overall teacher shortages, their main goal would be to reduce high rates of teacher turnover within individual schools and thereby to enhance the quality of those schools.

This edition of Charts of the Week examines teacher retention in the U.S.
TEACHER TURNOVER IS INHERENTLY DISRUPTIVE 
Teacher turnover—the yearly rate of departure of teachers from a school—in U.S. middle schools negatively impacts student achievement rates and has increased rapidly since 2012. Helen F. Ladd and Lucy Sorensen demonstrate that “higher teacher turnover leads to higher proportions of teachers with limited experience, lateral entry teachers or those with provisional licenses.”

STRONG PRINCIPALS RETAIN EFFECTIVE TEACHERS 
Jason A. Grissom notes that “the quality of a school’s leadership is among the most important predictors of teacher turnover.” According to Grissom, schools that have effective principals are “more likely to retain their best teachers and less likely to retain their lowest-performing teachers, a pattern we refer to as ‘strategic retention.’”

RECRUITING HIGHER-QUALITY PRESERVICE TEACHERS MAY REDUCE TEACHER TURNOVER 
Many schools and districts find it difficult to identify high-quality, long-term teachers, especially among young professionals just joining the workforce. Robert Vagi, Margarita Pivovarova, and Wendy Miedel Barnard illustrate that “some initial evidence [shows] that both preparing and recruiting higher-quality preservice teachers into the profession may ultimately help reduce teacher turnover.”

In this week’s Charts of the week, some demographics of the teaching profession are explored, focusing on how the field is becoming increasingly more female and how the diversity gap is growing parallel to that.  
The teacher diversity gap is inherited
In their paper, Seth Gershenson and Alberto Jacinto show that “the children of teachers are more than twice as likely to become teachers themselves,” and this finding holds true for all but the sons of black teachers. Over the past few decades, the teacher workforce has remained about 80% white and mostly female, a trend that will most likely not break unless there are more efforts to understand why people enter the teaching profession and how to recruit more diverse educators.

The teaching profession is becoming more female
As the labor market opened in the 20th century and women were granted more job, education, and economic opportunities, it was predicted that women would begin to branch out from careers outside of teaching and nursing. Dick Startz has found the opposite to be true, showing that over time the teaching profession has become increasingly more female dominated.

US teachers are more segregated than their students
As evidence shows that diverse teachers are important for educational outcomes for students, Michael Hansen and Diana Quintero discuss the continued segregation  of minority teachers across the teacher workforce. Hansen and Quintero show that “nonwhite teachers are needed in far more places than we currently have them, and those many schools with no teachers of color are the places that need them most.”

Decades of research have shown that teachers are the single most important school-based factor in student achievement. The research base on teacher attrition continues to grow as teacher turnover remains a salient issue for many schools, particularly in economically disadvantaged districts. A high level of turnover is negatively associated with student achievement and there are monetary (and human capital) costs of replacing teachers. Moreover, teacher mobility patterns play an important role in the equitable education of all students, and there is strong evidence of inequities in access to highly effective instruction across schools and districts.

Taking advantage of the robust literature on factors of teacher attrition and retention, working with Lam Pham and Michael Crouch at Vanderbilt, we conducted an exhaustive search reviewing more than 25,000 scholarly records and synthesizing effects across 120 of these studies to better understand what drives teacher mobility. This post describes the findings from our analysis and offers some discussion on their policy implications.
What we know about teacher attrition and retention
For our meta-analysis, we adopt a school-centered perspective. In other words, we focus on whether teachers leave a particular school, regardless of whether they move to another school or leave the profession entirely (though our results are substantively similar when looking at attrition from the profession).
We examine factors in three primary categories that influence teacher attrition. “Personal correlates” refer to teacher characteristics—such as age, race/ethnicity, and gender—and qualifications that may shape teachers’ decisions to leave a school. “School correlates” contain factors that describe the schools and conditions in which the teachers work, including school organizational characteristics and school resources. “External correlates” are factors that come from national or state policies, such as accountability and school improvement efforts. Since our study includes several dozen factors across the three categories, we discuss a few of the more relevant findings in this brief.
Focusing first on personal correlates, in contrast to prior narrative reviews and meta-analyses, we find female teachers are no more likely to leave than male teachers, and that teachers with graduate degrees are no more likely to leave than teachers without graduate degrees. We find teaching specialty areas, such as STEM or special education, significantly increases the odds of attrition. We do not find all minority teachers are less likely to leave; only Hispanic teachers have reduced odds of attrition relative to white teachers. We also find strong evidence that teacher satisfaction plays an important role in teacher decisions to stay in teaching. Moreover, traditionally certified teachers are less likely to leave teaching than those teachers entering through alternative routes.

America faces a substitute teacher shortage—and disadvantaged schools are hit hardest

In terms of school correlates, we consistently find various measures of school organizational characteristics—such as student disciplinary problems, administrative support, and professional development—strongly influence teacher turnover. In terms of school resources, we find providing basic teaching materials, such as textbooks and binders, reduces odds of attrition. We find most characteristics of the student body do not seem to influence attrition (or that the influences are small).
Finally, we find that many external correlates are associated with teacher attrition and retention. Interestingly, being evaluated, even for accountability purposes, does not seem to increase teacher attrition. In fact, the odds of attrition for teachers who are assessed are somewhat smaller than those who are not.
Compelling evidence of improving school organizational characters to reduce turnover
Our meta-analytic findings have important implications for policy, practice, and future research. We find some suggestive, if limited, evidence that retention bonuses and limiting late hiring could reduce teacher turnover. Not surprising to those in the trenches, additional supports and incentives appear necessary to keep specific types of teachers in their school—namely, STEM teachers, special education teachers, and novice teachers.
We see some evidence that improving school organizational characteristics, such as reducing student disciplinary problems and improving administrative support and teacher collaborations, can reduce the risk of turnover. We are not suggesting it would be simple to change these organizational features, but the evidence warrants further exploration. While there are efforts being made in this area, we need more research and experimentation to bear on these issues.
Could evaluation and accountability improve the teacher workforce?
Despite concerns of potential negative consequences of teacher evaluation and accountability, we do not find that performance evaluations increase teacher exit. To the contrary, we find when teachers are evaluated and the results of their evaluations or measures of effectiveness are made available, teachers are no more likely to leave. In fact, the evidence suggests that teachers may be enticed to stay as they are provided with some urgency, sense of empowerment, and evidence of areas for professional improvement. This holds true even when teacher evaluations are being used for accountability and pay raises.
Related, teachers in merit-based pay programs are less likely to leave teaching than those who are not. This is noteworthy when paired with the fact that we find evaluation and accountability policies tend to be associated with keeping the most effective teachers as measured by value-added scores and removing the least effective teachers. Although differentiated compensation can be a contentious practice, it does provide suggestive evidence of the important role that strategic compensation reforms can play in improving the composition of the teacher workforce. We have a separate paper that examines merit pay in depth.
Ultimately, while there may be negative consequences and warranted concerns about teacher evaluation and accountability policies, they are positively perceived by some teachers and have more beneficial effects than previously recognized. Evaluation and accountability practices may improve the teacher workforce and reduce turnover.
Areas in need of further development and research
It is important to put findings from our meta-analysis in context of future research on teacher turnover. Two areas requiring further development and exploration are relational demography (e.g., the race-matching between teachers and principals, or between teachers and students) and school improvement. There are only a few studies on the relationship between relational demography and attrition. The same holds true for how school reforms and research-practice partnerships influence teacher attrition and retention. The nascent evidence, however, suggests relational demography, particularly parity between principal-teacher, may reduce turnover.
While there is an ever larger proportion of studies using quasi-experimental techniques to estimate causal effects of programs and policies on teacher attrition and retention, we need to further explore policy levers that can positively impact the teacher labor force and improve the educational opportunities for students from traditionally marginalized backgrounds. In an effort to propel this dialogue, our meta-analysis offers nuance to many commonly held beliefs on teacher turnover while providing new suggestive evidence of what we can do to positively impact the profession. It is now time for policy, practice, and future research to push our understanding and impact further.

When I write about teacher pay and teacher work I get a lot of feedback. In particular, I am inundated with two responses presented as arguments about whether teachers deserve higher pay.

Many teachers work very long hours during the school year. (Supporting higher pay.)
Many teachers don’t work very many hours at all. (Suggesting teachers are already overpaid.)

So, do the facts support both arguments? No.
In other words, neither strong view has much relation in reality to how many hours teachers put in. Sure, some teachers put in hour after hour after hour. Sure, some teachers manage to get away with hardly working at all. But overall, teachers’ work hours look pretty much like other college graduates’ hours. First let’s go to the evidence, then once we have the answer I’ll argue the question isn’t very helpful.

Measuring hours worked for large groups isn’t easy because if you ask people, they tend to exaggerate the number of hours they put in. The right way to track how people spend their time is to ask them to keep a “time diary,” where every 15 minutes they write down their current activity. Keeping a time diary doesn’t highlight any particular activity, thereby avoiding a good deal of conscious and unconscious bias. Time diaries are believed to lead to pretty accurate reporting. The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) asks thousands of people to keep just such a diary for a 24-hour period. The data collected there lets us compare hours worked by teachers to the hours worked by other college-educated, full-time workers.
Good academic research on the question appears in an article in Education Finance and Policy by Kristine L. West. For most practical purposes, teachers and nonteachers work about the same number of hours per week during the school year. West did find some differences. During the school year, her calculations show that teachers work 39.8 hours per week while nonteachers work 41.5 hours. During the summer, teachers do work noticeably fewer hours. West reports that teachers work 21.5 hours per week during the summer. (Perhaps think of this as more like a half-time job than like “summer vacation.”)
Given West’s findings, I’ve believed for some time that the answer to the two arguments above should be both. Average work hours may not be much different but some teachers put in exceptionally long hours, while others really shirk. I was wrong; the answer is neither. Teachers are no more likely to work long hours than those in other occupations and also aren’t more likely to give work short shrift.
I went back to the ATUS (with the help of my research assistant) and, following West’s methodology, drew a newer and somewhat larger sample, all for full-time workers with college degrees. (Following West’s lead, I use the broader ATUS definition of “work related activities” for both teachers and nonteachers.) When it comes to average work during the school year, we found the same substantive answer as West. We found teachers work an average of 42.2 hours a week as compared to nonteachers working 43.2 hours.
We also found an interesting (but not substantively terribly important) switch when you control for gender. Women teachers work (a little) more than women nonteachers and men teachers work (a little) less than men nonteachers. The table here gives the splits. It’s worth remembering that a large majority of teachers are women while a majority of the nonteachers workforce are men—this is why the aggregate numbers suggest teachers work fewer hours, but that effect disappears once you control for gender.




Women
Men


Teachers
41.4
44.8


Nonteachers
40.1
45.0


Average weekly hours during the school year, excluding holidays



Even if average work hours aren’t much different between teachers and others, do we find teachers more than others working unusually long hours while another set of teachers work notably fewer hours? The quick pictorial answer is “no.” Here’s a picture of the distribution of weekly work hours for both teachers and nonteachers. There’s just no important difference between the two groups.

For those who prefer numbers to pictures, we’ve calculated the number of work hours at the low end (10th percentile) and high end (90th percentile) for both groups.




10th percentile
90th percentile


Teachers
15.0
55.0


Nonteachers
14.8
56.7


Weekly Work Hours



The data gives a clear conclusion: While there are some teachers who put in way above the expected number of hours and while there are also some teachers who shirk, that’s equally true for other workers. No difference—no distinction.

7 findings that illustrate racial disparities in education

Given that we have an answer to the original question, let me tell you why to an economist the question isn’t all that interesting. Asking about the number of hours a job requires, or necessary degrees, or other sorts of qualifications and abilities of employees is interesting but not dispositive. Some jobs are especially rewarding (say, working with kids); and some jobs are especially stressful (say, working with kids). The bottom line on deciding on compensation is whether you’re paying enough to get a sufficiently large supply of sufficiently good employees. In other words, if you think we have more great teachers than we need you should be okay with lower compensation rates. Contrariwise, if you think we need more great teachers than we have on board then you should want to raise salaries. That’s how a market system works—you get what you pay for.

Louisiana, home to the first Jim Crow law in 1890, holds an important lesson about how to diversify the teaching profession.
In 1969, a small group of African-American teachers, coaches, band directors, and principals formerly employed by Tangipahoa Parish, a county 40 miles northwest of New Orleans, sued the school board. They alleged that the district was engaging in “a policy and practice of coercing and intimidating Negro teachers in an effort to force Negro teachers to resign their positions.” The case lagged for seven years, but ultimately the faculty emerged victorious, and the school district agreed to an unusual consent decree: It would hire every qualified black teacher until the ratio of black to white teachers grew to 40:60, mirroring the student racial composition.

The legal and moral victory notwithstanding, for more than 35 years the agreement sat on a shelf, largely ignored by the district and unenforced by the court. But in 2010, with a boost from NAACP attorneys, the court reaffirmed the desegregation order, this time requiring the district to submit written explanations every time a qualified black applicant was passed over for a white one.
What was the result of this mandate and why is it important? We considered these questions in our new research paper in order to shed light on how to diversify the teaching profession. Studies have shown that students—especially minority students—benefit from having access to racially diverse teachers. In fact, according to one recent study, “having just one black teacher in third, fourth or fifth grade reduced low-income black boys’ probability of dropping out of high school by 39 percent.” Yet while more than 50 percent of public school students are minorities, fewer than 20 percent of teachers are (and even fewer are men of color). In a series of recent posts, the Brown Center has documented that this problem is widespread across the nation, and has proposed innovative ways to measure and address it.
Up until this point, much of the policy focus has been about how to increase the supply of minority teachers. African-American and Hispanic college graduates are less likely to hold a degree in teaching. Increasing this rate would help diversify the pipeline into teaching. Any long-term solution to increasing diversity must take into account increasing the supply of a diverse teaching workforce—but these policies necessarily make their impacts with a time lag.
Our research found that Tangipahoa Parish offers a faster approach. Just four years after the desegregation order was put in place, the share of black teachers had increased by approximately 5 percentage points relative to other districts in Louisiana—a substantial increase in a reasonably short period of time—from 17 to 22 percent (Figure 2). The increase appeared to be driven by a spike in the rate of hiring of new black teachers as opposed to changes by race in the rate of retirements or teacher departures, although the impact of the court order on black new teacher hiring is not statistically significant.
Click image to view in full size.
The “representation gap”—defined as the difference between the share of students that are black and the share of teachers that are black—declined by between 2 and 4 percentage points, depending on how we estimated this relationship (see Figure 2). And there were strong increases in the percent of black teachers even in schools that have a predominately white student body and schools that had low shares of black teachers at baseline.
We were not able to detect any impacts—either positive or negative—on student achievement from the change in the racial composition of the teacher workforce. Although there was ex ante concern that the court order would lead to a reduction in teacher quality, this proved untrue: In qualitative interviews conducted last summer, most teachers described the quality of their department’s teachers in recent years as improving.
The Tangipahoa experiences suggest that in order to efficiently diversify the teaching profession, we should turn more attention to the demand side of the teacher workforce equation. A large share of minorities with teaching degrees are not currently working as teachers. This is an untapped supply of qualified minority teachers who made it through the pipeline and did not find a teaching position. Many businesses have been taking steps to reduce biases in their hiring processes with a goal of diversifying their workforces. Should more school districts be doing the same? Could something be going wrong at the hiring stage that systematically disadvantages minority teacher candidates?

Of course, a court order is not the only way to increase hiring of minority candidates. Districts can voluntarily change their hiring practices in order to seek a more diverse teacher mix. In particular, there is evidence that adopting “soft” affirmative action policies—that is, policies that change the composition of the candidate pool, rather than changing the criteria used in the hiring process—can be very effective. Most famous is the National Football League’s “Rooney Rule,” which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for any head coaching vacancy. After the NFL adopted this policy, minority candidates were 20 percent more likely to fill a head coaching vacancy than before. Based on this success, other companies like Facebook have followed suit. Experts also recommend steps like carefully reviewing the wording of job postings to include pro-diversity language, expanding the recruitment pool, and standardizing the interview process across candidates.
Demand-side policies—including hiring reforms voluntarily adopted by schools and districts, as well as when necessary court-ordered reforms—can substantially increase the share of minority teachers in the classroom. More schools and districts should examine their recruiting and hiring processes to promote diversity.

Children often follow in their parents’ footsteps. For example, many children root for the same teams and like the same foods as their parents. But do they enter the same professions?
Over the past year, teacher strikes have brought to national attention the plight of teachers across the country. Teacher shortages and a lack of teacher diversity are major issues facing schools right now. Recent evidence shows that teacher shortages exist and are expected to worsen. So where do new teachers come from? Many come from existing teachers—that is, they inherit the teaching profession from their mothers.

Using nationally representative surveys of the cohorts that graduated high school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, we show that compared to other children, the children of teachers are more than twice as likely to become teachers themselves. This is true for the sons and daughters of white teachers and for the daughters of black teachers; the heritability of teaching is even stronger for the daughters of Hispanic teachers. The sons of black teachers are the only group who do not seem to follow in their mother’s professional footsteps.
Why does this matter?
Teachers are important and effective teachers are in relatively short supply. Yet it is difficult to identify effective teachers a priori, as many observable qualifications, at best, only loosely predict effectiveness. A striking exception is teacher race—specifically the race match between students and teachers—which boosts a plethora of student outcomes such as attendance [and here], behavior, achievement, and even high school graduation and college enrollment. This has led to a concerted, and growing, effort to recruit and retain more teachers of color and to diversify the teacher workforce so that it becomes more representative of the students they teach.
However, recent efforts to address the relative lack of racial diversity in the U.S. teaching force have been too little avail: The racial makeup of the teacher workforce has been relatively stagnant over the past few decades at about 80% white and mostly female. This is at odds with the racial composition of U.S. public school students, which has decreased from 70% to 50% white in recent decades. This is detrimental to students of color, who are less likely to experience the benefits of having a “teacher who looks like me” as a result of this imbalance. And it raises the question of why the racial composition of the teaching force is so “sticky.”
“We show that teaching is indeed transmitted from mother to child, and that this transmission occurs at greater rates than for other similar professions such as social work, counseling, and nursing.”
One possibility is that, at least in the case of teachers, children follow in their parents’ professional footsteps. If so, it is unsurprising that the majority of teachers continue to be white, as white teachers tend to have white children. We pursue this intergenerational story in a new IZA discussion paper. Using data from the nationally representative National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79) we show that teaching is indeed transmitted from mother to child, and that this transmission occurs at greater rates than for other similar professions such as social work, counseling, and nursing. Moreover, the transmission of teaching occurs at roughly equal rates for the sons and daughters of white teachers and the daughters of black teachers; interestingly, there is no such transmission for the sons of black teachers.
Overall, children whose mothers were teachers were nine percentage points, or 110%, more likely to become teachers than the children of mothers who were not teachers. Limited data on fathers’ occupation suggest a similar transmission of teaching from fathers to sons, but not to daughters. The figure below reports the effect of a child’s mother being a teacher on the child’s likelihood of entering teaching. These effects are relative to the baseline teaching rates of the children of nonteachers, which is 8%.

Why is teaching inherited?
Here we can only speculate, but we can rule out some simple explanations by leveraging the rich data collected in the NLSY-79 survey: It is not due to the socioeconomic or demographic background of teachers, nor is it due to ability or educational differences between teachers and nonteachers. Another possibility is that the transmission of teaching is due to parental pressure to follow in the mother’s footsteps; however, this too is unlikely, as we see similar transmission rates for both sons and daughters of white teachers and that the transmission of teaching is actually weaker for single than married mothers.
This leaves a few related candidate explanations. Importantly, these are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and might well work in concert with one another. First, having a mother who is a teacher might provide access to a network of resources, supports, and job opportunities. Second, having a mother who is a teacher might provide information, either actively or passively (as a role model), about the attractiveness of the job in a way that alters children’s perceived possible or preferred careers. Third, teaching requires a certain level of altruism, extroversion, and comfort with working with children. Perhaps personality factors, in combination with the profession, are inherited from parents, which may make children more likely to go on to become teachers. Though evidence for this story is somewhat limited by the lack of transmission of counseling, social work, and nursing across generations. Risk aversion is another possibly heritable trait that might contribute to the transmission of teaching, which is viewed as a relatively safe career. Indeed, in a family of teachers, a father’s advice to his son was “You’ll never get rich, but you’ll never go broke.”

Still, much remains to be learned about who enters teaching, and why. It would be fruitful for future research to investigate the channels through which this sort of intergenerational transmission occurs, as it has important implications for the recruitment of a diverse teaching force and more generally for understanding who enters teaching, and why. Similarly, it is unclear whether teachers who entered the profession due to parental influences are more or less effective than teachers who entered the field for other reasons. This, too, merits consideration, as providing all students with access to effective teachers is paramount to providing equal opportunity to all.
Teaching is a family business
Families with multiple generations of teachers are neither rare nor quirky oddities: 44% of teachers were themselves the children of teachers. Schools, districts, and colleges of education should take note of this understudied, under-realized fact.

There is a global learning crisis, as education systems around the world are struggling to provide a high-quality education that will prepare students to succeed in an interconnected, rapidly changing world (Desai, 2018). In addition, a majority of children in public education systems are first-generation school-goers or learners and do not have some of the required capacities to engage in learning due to adverse childhood experiences (Kennedy, Pearson, Brett-Taylor, Talreja 2014). Education has a large purpose to serve, and recent research suggests that a primary purpose is to create confident, mindful, responsible, and happy individuals that contribute. In today’s society, developing literacy and numeracy skills is not enough, and students must learn how to think critically, interact effectively, and work collaboratively. In addition, with increasing global challenges, such as income inequality, poverty, growing intolerance, and rising suicide rates of students, there has been a growing focus on promoting student happiness and well-being (Twenge, Cooper, Joiner, Duffy, & Binau 2019). In July 2018, the Delhi government launched the Happiness Curriculum (HC) in 1,030 government schools from kindergarten to Grade 8, to focus on the holistic development of all learners. This is consistent with the vision for India’s education system as outlined in the New National Education Policy 2019, as well as the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.

As part of the program, students spend one period each day in Happiness Classes engaging in a variety of games, reflective conversations, storytelling, guided practice for mindfulness, role-playing, and presentations. These activities are designed to target essential skills, as well as the more holistic competencies believed to contribute to happiness and well-being.
The study upon which this report is based was designed to complete the first step toward an evaluation of the program. This step was to develop tools that would provide information to schools, nongovernment organization implementers, and government agencies concerning student and teacher adoption of the desired outcomes of the HC. The two surveys developed—one for students and one for teachers—reflect factors which are aligned with the HC objectives and learning outcomes. For anticipated use in evaluation studies, the two surveys provide a basis for the capture of student and teacher functioning on the factors of interest.
This report provides:

a summary of the factors believed to contribute to happiness, as reflected in the HC;
information about the process undertaken to develop a survey approach to measuring these factors; and
a description of the issues confronting educators as they evaluate the program.

Social mobility and income inequality
In this engaging and unique video, Richard Reeves uses LEGO blocks to illustrate how inequality affects the American Dream, revealing dismal prospects for underprivileged Americans to move up the socio-economic ladder.

In another video using LEGO blocks, David Wessel explains whether changes in the U.S. tax code can alter income inequality in America.

In America, the 1 percent are the villains. Everyone else—the 99 percent—are the good guys, right? Not so, argues Richard Reeves in his book Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why That Is a Problem, and What to Do About It. The real class divide, he says, is not between the upper class and everyone else; it is between the upper middle class and everyone else. To illustrate his argument, Brookings created a short, interactive game to help you determine whether or not you are hoarding the American dream.

When considering proposals to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans to reduce inequality, fund programs benefiting lower income households, and mitigate the amount of dynastic wealth in the U.S., how should we differentiate wealth-off Americans from the really rich? What would federal policies – like a wealth tax – could be implemented? And what negative consequences do critics believe these policies entail? David Wessel explains:

Race and discrimination in America
Housing is just one area where Black Americans suffer from discriminatory public policies. Throughout the United States, homes in Black neighborhoods are priced around 23 percent less than those in white neighborhoods, a difference of nearly $50,000 per home which totals to about $156 billion in lost assets. In this video, Andre Perry, author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities, explains how there is nothing wrong with Black people that ending racism can’t solve, and why we must work to overcome inequalities by countering the policy-based devaluation of the Black community.


Homeownership is central to achieving the American Dream, yet racist federal housing policy (redlining) shut out too many Black Americans from the chance to buy homes and build wealth.In this report and interactive infographic, Brookings researchers examine the true cost of racial bias. The interactive component compares home values in majority Black neighborhoods in 113 metropolitan areas with at least one Black majority neighborhood.

Today, the average white family has about 10 times the wealth as the average Black family. White college graduates have more than 7 times more wealth than Black college graduates. No wonder the American Dream seems out of reach for so many Black Americans. In their essay, Rashawn Ray and Andre Perry argue that the U.S. government should pay reparations restore the wealth deferred to Black citizens due to slavery and racial policies designed to deny wealth-building opportunities.

Molly Reynolds explains the history of the Senate filibuster and the possible, but politically unlikely, ways to reform or eliminate it.

Research consistently shows that effective teachers are the most important school-level factor influencing student outcomes. It therefore comes as no surprise that many education reform efforts focus on supporting and improving the teaching profession. At the same time, technology-focused initiatives continue to gain momentum in education—as seen through the White House’s ConnectEd Initiative and the more than 3,100 superintendents who have signed the Department of Education’s Future Ready pledge to increase student access to quality digital learning.
In the competition for scarce education dollars, these two advocacy camps sometimes conflict, especially if technology seems to be a play for cutting teacher jobs. But teachers and technology are only at odds when advocates from the respective camps fail to see technology’s critical role in complementing high-quality teaching.
In “Teaching in the Machine Age,” a paper recently published by the Clayton Christensen Institute, I provide general frameworks for thinking about the optimal roles teachers and technology should each play in schools of the future.
As the paper notes, many professions outside of education benefit from innovations that simplify and automate some of the tasks of experts, thereby freeing experts to spend more time and energy practicing at the top of their field. For example, MetaMind, a startup that develops artificial intelligence software, uses natural language processing, computer vision, and database prediction algorithms to analyze medical scans for tumors and lesions. Assisted by this technology, doctors no longer need to spend a lot of time scouring images for abnormalities. Instead, they can allocate that time to seeing patients and developing treatments.
Similarly, in the field of animation, computer animation technologies substitute for humans in performing laborious rules-based tasks such as manually drawing and coloring all the individual images in an animated sequence. But in doing so, they allow expert animators and artists to focus their time and creativity on tasks that cannot be automated, including imbuing characters with persona-forming appearances, movements, and gestures.
When it comes to education, computers’ speed and computational accuracy give them a comparative advantage for tasks such as assessing students’ knowledge of basic facts and skills, tracking students’ learning progress, presenting academic content, and adapting instruction to students’ individual learning needs. Meanwhile, good teachers are irreplaceable assets for coaching and mentoring students, addressing the social and emotional factors affecting students’ learning, and providing students with expert feedback on complicated human skills such as critical thinking, creative problem solving, communication, and project management.

The New Humanism: Technology should enhance, not replace, human interactions

Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, Molly Schlesinger, Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, and Esther Care
Monday, June 11, 2018






Nonetheless, for some educators, these ideas of computer automation and task commoditization come across as threatening rhetoric aimed at displacing teachers. After all, many stories about the advent of smart machines are not as serendipitous as those of physicians and animators. One of the largest challenges facing our modern economy is figuring out how to find new employment for factory workers, taxi drivers, bank loan officers, retail clerks, and a host of other workers whose jobs are being eliminated by smart machines.
Yet, job displacement fears are unlikely to pan out in the teaching profession, given the very different skills needed to be a teacher. Innovations that automate and commoditize professional expertise only threaten the job security of professionals when their jobs consist entirely of complex yet rules-based tasks, such as preparing common tax returns or legal documents. For professionals whose jobs are full of higher-order tasks that cannot be reduced to rules-based instructions, innovations that simplify and automate professional expertise serve to enhance—rather than substitute for—experts’ abilities.
Given the many ways in which technology can enhance and amplify great teaching, I think the future of the profession looks incredibly bright. But that future depends on what we expect of our education system. If we task schools merely with helping students memorize basic facts and skills to pass bubble tests, then teaching will likely become entirely automated.
But if our goal is to help students develop deeper learning and 21st-century skills that they will need to thrive in modern society, then technology cannot eliminate the need for teachers. In fact, technology will be critical for enabling teachers to rise to the enormous responsibilities we place on their shoulders. As the paper points out, combining teachers and technology affords education leaders new options for addressing teacher shortages, providing students with differentiated instruction, and giving teachers capacity to focus on deeper learning and noncognitive skills.
Investing in teachers and technology should not be seen as “either/or” propositions. With recent advances in the science of teaching and in artificial intelligence, educators have unprecedented opportunities to redesign traditional instructional models and rethink traditional teaching roles in ways that amplify the impact of teachers. In short, let technology do what it does best so that teachers can focus on the teaching activities for which their human expertise is most needed.

Executive Summary
Colleges and universities must balance many goals, and research universities in particular aspire to excellence in both teaching and research. University administrators and policymakers alike are interested in ensuring that publicly-supported private and public universities operate at high levels of instructional and scholarly quality, but to date we know little about whether scholarly excellence comes at a cost in terms of teaching quality, or vice versa.
We bring to bear unique matched student-faculty data from Northwestern University, a midsized research university that is one of the 26 private universities among the 62 members of the Association of American Universities, to investigate the relationship between teaching and scholarly quality. Using the full population of all first-year undergraduates enrolled at Northwestern between fall 2001 and fall 2008 (over 15,000 students in all), we empirically generate two new measures of teaching quality—one an indicator of inspiration (the rate of “conversion” of non-majors to majors) and the other an indicator of deep learning (the degree to which a professor adds lasting value to students’ learning that is reflected in success in future classes). We also investigate two measures of research quality—one based on a measure of the relative importance of a scholar’s research in the field, and the other a measure of national or international prominence as reflected by major awards.
We find that, regardless of our measure of teaching quality or our measure of research quality employed, there is no relationship between the teaching quality and research quality of tenured Northwestern faculty. Our estimates are “precise zeroes,” indicating that it’s unlikely that mismeasurement of teaching or research quality explains the lack of a relationship between the two. Therefore, while Northwestern admittedly occupies a rarefied space in the hierarchy of American universities, our results suggest that excellent teaching and excellent research are not substitutes (though neither are they apparently complements).

Colleges and universities have a variety of output goals. At a research university, scholarly output is critical, but so is successful teaching at the undergraduate, professional school, and graduate levels. Some faculty members are fabulous at both core tasks. They are revered by undergraduates for their ability in the classroom, even when teaching at the most basic, introductory level. At the same time, they are widely recognized by their peers for their research excellence. On the other hand, some faculty are much more proficient in publishing than in teaching, while some excel mainly in the classroom. Others, unfortunately, struggle at both.
Given how important these different desired outcomes are for university administrators and policymakers interested in ensuring that their publicly-supported private and public universities operate at high levels of instructional and scholarly quality, one would think that deans, provosts, and presidents would know quite a bit about the production of both top-notch research and top-notch teaching, and, in particular, they would know whether faculty who are superstars in the undergraduate classroom pay a price in terms of scholarly recognition.[i] Knowing the answer to this question could help institutions better allocate their scarce resources.
Unfortunately, that kind of analysis is hampered by two issues—the difficulty in measuring teaching effectiveness, and the difficulty in comparing research success across a wide range of academic fields. A long literature[ii] on the relationship between teaching and research excellence spanning four decades (including papers published recently[iii]) considers various measures of each of these professorial attributes. Previous studies measure research excellence based on number of publications, grants awarded, number of citations, peer/department chair rating, time spent on research activities, faculty membership in academic research societies, and awards for research. While some of these measures are plausible indicators of research quality, others are either quite narrow or do not promote comparability across disciplines. Meanwhile, studies in the existing literature have been even more hampered by limitations in measuring teaching quality. Previous analyses of the teaching-research relationship have used student course evaluations, peer evaluations, time spent on teaching activities, and nomination or receipt of a teaching award as teaching quality measures,[iv] but these measures have substantial limitations. Student evaluations frequently reflect popularity or grading standards, rather than genuine instructional quality, and exhibit gender, racial, and ethnic biases,[v] while peer reviews are subject to “halo effects” resulting from evaluators’ knowledge of a faculty member’s research record.[vi] What is needed are measures of teaching effectiveness that are not subject to these types of biases.

Morton O. Schapiro
Professor of Economics and President - Northwestern University





In this report we propose two measures of teaching outcomes and two indicators of research prominence in order to directly assess the relationship between teaching and research excellence. Our measures of research prominence are along the lines as those employed in previous work, but with some refinements to allow us to compare across disciplines. We empirically derive our measures of teaching excellence from data on student follow-on course-taking and future performance. One of the measures of teaching quality is an indicator of inspiration while the other is an indicator of deep learning.
We study the teaching and research quality of tenured faculty members at Northwestern University, a midsized research university that is one of the 26 private universities among the 62 members of the Association of American Universities. We construct our teaching measures using registrar data on all Northwestern University freshmen who entered between fall 2001 and fall 2008, a total of 15,662 students, and on the faculty who taught them during their first quarter at Northwestern. In a recent paper, we document that student course-taking during that term appeared to be essentially random with regard to measures of faculty quality, providing indicators of teaching quality that are unaffected by student non-random selection.[vii]
Methods
We focus here just on the 170 tenured faculty members who taught at least 20 first quarter students across the eight cohorts. We limit our analyses to those with 20 or more observations of first quarter students in order to reduce the likelihood that outliers are influencing our measures of teaching quality.[viii] We concentrate on tenured faculty members because they have had longer to establish the teaching and research track records necessary to carry out this analysis, and because they have already met the high bar of teaching, research, and service necessary for tenure at a leading American research university.
We describe the first of our teaching measures in some detail in our paper cited above.[ix] We build on the work of other researchers[x] in examining the likelihood of taking additional courses in a subject area as a measure of teaching excellence—the more likely a student is to continue studying in a particular discipline, the better the teacher is thought to have been. We then take this approach further by developing our own objective measure—the deviation in the grade received by a student in follow-up courses in that subject. A successful undergraduate teacher in, say, introductory biology, not only induces his or her students to take additional biology courses, but leads those students to do unexpectedly well in those additional classes (based on what we would have predicted based on their standardized test scores, other grades, grading standards in that field, etc.)  In our earlier paper, we lay out the statistical techniques[xi] employed in controlling for course and student impacts other than those linked directly to the teaching effectiveness of the original professor. Similar approaches to measuring instructor quality using follow-on course performance have been employed by other scholars.[xii]
This is an imperfect measure of teaching success. An especially poor teacher may lead students to switch from that subject entirely—hence we would have no information on how their students would have done in subsequent courses. In addition, our data set centers on success in teaching courses open to first-quarter freshmen, most of which are introductory courses. In around one-fifth of cases, they are intermediate or upper-division classes taken by students with prior experience in the subject such as that gained through AP classes in high school.[xiii] Finally, and most importantly, perhaps some faculty look to be poor teachers by our measure, but do a better teaching senior seminars for undergraduates or graduate courses. Teaching is certainly not limited to what takes place in a classroom full of first year undergraduates.
Our second indicator of teaching effectiveness uses the same data set but focuses on majors rather than grades. Compelling teachers presumably inspire students into majoring in their disciplines, whether those students were predisposed to doing so or not. A talented chemistry teacher in an introductory course may lead a declared chemistry major to keep that major; but even more impressively, that professor may convince an undeclared student to major in chemistry, or lead a student majoring in physics or economics to become a chemistry major. The ability to convert majors presumably reflects an important dimension of teaching excellence.
In essence, therefore, our two measures of teaching quality reflect, in the first case, value added (or “deep learning”) that is transferrable to subsequent classes in the subject, and, in the second case, inspiration, as indicated by the ability to convert students to a subject that they had not previously planned on studying in depth. Interestingly, the faculty members who are most successful in inspiring students to become majors in their subject are not any more distinguished in facilitating “deep learning”: the correlation between the two measures of teaching quality is virtually zero (the correlation coefficient is trivial, at -0.025), suggesting that these two dimensions of teaching quality are essentially unrelated. That is, charismatic teachers who leave scores of majors in their wake, appear to be no better or worse at teaching the material than their less inspiring counterparts; teachers who are exceptional at conveying course material are no more likely than others at inspiring students to take more courses in the subject area.
These separate measures of teaching excellence allow us to address empirically whether those faculty who do particularly well in the classroom pay a price in terms of their scholarship. But first, a word about our scholarship measures. While measuring scholarly excellence is somewhat less contentious than is the case of evaluating teaching effectiveness, it is nonetheless fraught. In some fields, well-received books indicate success, in others it is performances, and still others it is highly-cited articles or the awarding of grants. How might one recognize stellar scholarship across chemistry and theater, engineering and music, economics and English, mathematics and anthropology?
We employ two very different scholarship measures. Fortunately, for each year since 1988, Northwestern has had a faculty committee comprised of distinguished professors from a wide range of disciplines whose task has been to review the scholarly accomplishments of the faculty over the previous academic year, and select a subset to be honored for their research excellence at an annual dinner. Reasons for being honored include recognition by the leading scholarly organizations in their fields such as being elected into the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering or Medicine, or into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, receipt of prestigious fellowships such as those given by the MacArthur and Guggenheim Foundations, winning major research awards from top scholarly associations, and comparable achievements. Using this measure of research prominence, 57 percent of the 170 tenured faculty in our data set have been recognized at least once as an extraordinary scholar.
As an alternative measure, we followed a more traditional approach and constructed for each faculty member a within-department indicator of how influential that person’s scholarly work has been. Specifically, we compute a scholar’s h-index—an indicator that simultaneously measures frequency of publications and the scholarly influence of those publications, thereby capturing aspects of both a researcher’s productivity and the significance of that person’s work. We then adjust this h-index so that we are comparing each scholar to his or her own colleagues at Northwestern. We carry out this within-Northwestern-department adjustment to take into account the fact that publication and citation norms vary dramatically across disciplines, and because some Northwestern departments are more eminent than others. Nonetheless, there exists very substantial within-department variation in tenured faculty h-indices.
These two measures of research quality are much more highly-correlated than are our two measures of teaching success: faculty members whose research have been recognized by the university average in the 49th percentile of tenured faculty field-adjusted h-indices, while those who have not been recognized for their research average in the 36th percentile of tenured faculty field-adjusted h-indices.[xiv]
Results
With these two measures of teaching quality and two measures of research quality, we make four comparisons of teaching quality and research quality among the tenured Northwestern faculty in our sample. Our bottom line is that, regardless of our measure of teaching and research quality, there is no apparent relationship between teaching quality and research quality.
Figure 1: Relationship between percentile rank of instructor value added and probability of being recognized for research excellence

Figure 1 compares our value-added measure of teaching quality to the probability of being recognized for one’s research. For ease of illustration, we group the faculty members into 20 equal-sized instructor quality bins, but we use the disaggregated data to estimate relationships. The relationship is essentially flat: with each percentile improvement in measured teaching value-added, a faculty member is 0.025 percentage points less likely to be recognized for research quality. This is a very precisely-estimated zero: the standard error of this estimate is just 0.14 percentage points. Put differently, an instructor at the 75th percentile of the instructor value-added distribution is only one percentage point less likely to be recognized for research evidence than would an instructor at the 25th percentile of the value-added distribution.
Figure 2: Relationship between percentile rank of instructor “conversion rate” and probability of being recognized for research excellence

We see the same lack of a relationship when we instead measure instructor quality using the “conversion rate”—an indicator capturing a very different aspect of instructor quality than the value-added measure does. As with the previous measure of instructor quality, we express this as a within-sample ranking. We present this relationship in Figure 2. (Note that the leftmost point on the graph is unevenly spaced because 32 percent of faculty studied convert no undecided students to majors.) We observe again that there is a precisely-estimated zero relationship between this alternative measure of instructor quality and the probability of research recognition: with each percentile increase in the instructor’s conversion rate rank, a faculty member is 0.08 percentage points less likely to be recognized for research quality. The standard error of this estimate is just 0.13 percentile points. This means that an instructor at the 75th percentile of the “conversion rate” distribution is just four percentage points less likely to be recognized for research evidence than would an instructor at the 25th percentile of the distribution.
Figure 3: Relationship between percentile rank of instructor value added and percentile rank of discipline-weighted h-index

We repeat the same two analyses using the field-adjusted h-index as a measure of research excellence. Figure 3 compares our value-added measure of teaching quality to a faculty member’s percentile rank in the field-adjusted h-index. Again, the relationship is virtually flat: with each percentile point improvement in measured teaching value-added, a faculty member is 0.067 percentile points higher in the h-index ranking. The standard error of this estimate is 0.114. Therefore, the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile of the teacher quality distribution, measured in terms of value-added, is just three percentile points in the h-index distribution (and the opposite signed relationship as seen with the other measure of research quality).
Figure 4: Relationship between percentile rank of instructor “conversion rate” and percentile rank of discipline-weighted h-index

Figure 4 presents the same comparison, with the “conversion rate” measure of instructor quality. With each percentage point improvement in measured teacher quality, a faculty member is 0.037 percentile points higher in the h-index ranking (standard error of 0.108), implying a difference in the h-index distribution of only two percentile points between the 25th and 75th percentile teachers.
In sum, regardless of our measure of effective teaching or exemplary scholarship, we find that top teachers are no more or less likely to be especially productive scholars than their less accomplished teaching peers. This is encouraging for those who fear that great teachers specialize in pedagogy at the expense of research. On the other hand, it is disappointing to observe that weak undergraduate teachers do not make up for their limitations in the classroom with disproportionate research excellence.
Discussion, implications, and limitations
What does this analysis imply in terms of the growing trend of having introductory undergraduate courses being taught by non-tenure line faculty as opposed to “superstar” researchers? Our findings suggest that superb teaching does not come at the cost of diminished scholarship. Are great teachers poor scholars? Not according to our measures of teaching and research prominence. It appears that, at least in the scope of teaching by tenure line Northwestern faculty, the factors that drive teaching excellence and those that determine research excellence appear unrelated.
These findings have implications both for university administrators as well as for policymakers. Some individuals in these groups prioritize research excellence over teaching quality, while others prioritize teaching excellence over research quality. Our analysis implies that policymakers worried about whether research efforts will come at the expense of teaching, or vice versa, should have their fears at least partially allayed. But what if state legislators take seriously our finding that while top teachers don’t sacrifice research output, it is also the case that top researchers don’t teach exceptionally well? Why have those high-priced scholars in the undergraduate classroom in the first place? Surely it would be more cost efficient to replace them either with untenured, lower paid, professors or faculty not on the tenure-line in the first place. That, of course, is what has been happening throughout American higher education for the past several decades. We would caution here that illustrious research faculty provide a draw for students and faculty alike. Even if their teaching isn’t exceptional, their presence often is. Having them teaching freshmen sends a signal to the community that the school takes undergraduate education seriously—it isn’t just research and the production of Ph.D. students that matters.
What about the recent move at the University of California towards effectively tenuring some of their full-time teaching faculty? This analysis suggests that if one of the motivations for moving undergraduate teaching from faculty with responsibility for both teaching and research to faculty whose sole responsibility is teaching is to protect the time of the former group for scholarship, this assumption needs to be questioned. Moreover, our previous paper shows that the gap in teaching performance between tenure-line and contingent faculty depends entirely on differential teaching at the low end of the value-added distribution—there are very few teaching faculty demonstrating very low levels of teaching excellence as opposed to the tenure-line faculty, where the bottom fifth or so display extremely weak teaching.[xv] Presumably, weak contingent faculty are not renewed. While we certainly see the strong benefit of offering job security for teaching-track faculty (and recognize that higher levels of job protections likely attracts more excellent teachers to the university), giving them de facto tenure would eliminate this important lever for department chairs, deans and provosts.
Of course, this analysis has its limitations. For one, it’s possible that we find no relationship between teaching success and research quality because we can measure neither perfectly, or because there’s not enough variation in one measure or another to detect results. However, the fact that we find very “precise zeros”—that is, we don’t find statistically significant relationships even though we have the statistical power in our data to detect even very modest relationships—implies that neither measurement error nor a lack of sufficient variation are what’s driving our inability to detect a relationship between teaching and research quality. It’s also possible that our results are driven by “star” researchers teaching fewer classes than other tenured faculty, but the within-department variation in teaching loads among tenured faculty at Northwestern don’t seem large enough to be responsible for our findings.
A bigger shortcoming of our analysis has to do with external validity: Northwestern occupies a rarefied place in the distribution of American universities, and it may be the case that Northwestern faculty members are particularly adept at balancing both their research and teaching expectations. We look only at tenured faculty members—so they’ve already experienced a very stringent screen regarding research quality, and perhaps many extraordinary teachers who were relatively weak scholars didn’t make it into our analysis.[xvi] And don’t forget that research universities—and liberal arts colleges with significant research expectations for their faculty—are a modest part of all of U.S. higher education. Most professors teach heavy loads with little or no research expectations. For them, the question of whether their undergraduate teaching adversely affects their research productivity is moot. Moreover, research universities have teaching expectations that are much lower than at other schools. Some faculty at regional or local universities or colleges will undoubtedly argue that if they were teaching 3 or 4 courses per year as opposed to 8 or more, they too would have the time to be recognized scholars.
But still, research matters at places that take it seriously. The reason why most of the top-rated universities in the world are located in the United States is not what goes on in its classrooms; it is the research power of its faculties. This is reflected as well by the recent finding by Courant and Turner that faculty salaries at research universities are determined primarily by research performance and the reputation that comes with it.[xvii] We hope that faculty and administrators at other institutions will be inspired by this study to carry out similar exercises to see whether their tenured faculty teaching entering undergraduates pay a price in terms of research productivity.
Read a college guidebook or go on a college tour. Over and over you see pictures of and hear stories about superstar research faculty teaching freshmen. Pulitzer Prize winners, Nobel Laureates, National Academy Members—all in the undergraduate classroom. Whether that properly represents reality is one question; what we address here is whether it should represent reality. Without finding a tradeoff between great teaching and great research, we believe this to be an advantageous allocation of faculty talent.

There are 60,000 fewer public education jobs than there were before the recession began in 2007, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). States and districts haven’t moved on from the austerity measures imposed by most states more than a decade ago when the recession hit. “If we include the number of jobs that should have been created just to keep up with growing student enrollment,” the report states, “we are currently experiencing a 307,000 job shortfall in public education.”

A shortfall of more than 300,000 jobs in public education. Think about that the next time news of a teacher strike hits the headlines. Maybe severe budget cuts made sense to folks in 2007, but the underlying rationale behind firing teachers has never made sense to me.
In the Obama years, Republicans and Democrats alike were delighted to find common cause against teachers. Students weren’t doing so well, they argued, because their teachers simply weren’t good enough. Education reform was the name of the game, and everyone who wasn’t a quality teacher just had to go.
Problem was, that was a myopic view of the world. Neither students nor teachers exist in a vacuum. As I like to say, students don’t live in schools—they live in communities. And when their communities are negatively affected, that has a negative impact on them. So, if you fire a whole bunch of Black teachers—as education reformers did with devastating effect in New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Newark, New Jersey, around the time of the recession—that’s going to have ripple effects on their families and communities.
The charter school era was predicated on the notion of breaking up the monopoly that unions have on schools. Collective bargaining agreements, aka union contracts, had a stranglehold on schools, reformers cried. It was impossible to get rid of bad teachers, they argued. They linked student outcomes solely to teacher performance, and got rid of the teachers they deemed ineffective.
But isolating one factor didn’t do the trick. Most of the teachers fired were Black, and most of the charter schools were concentrated in districts that were majority Black. This caused upheaval in Black communities, which are disproportionately represented in public sector union jobs. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the share of Black workers in unions, at 12.5%, is the highest among the major racial groups. Education services professions represent the second-highest unionization rate among all occupations.)
With the firings, reformers ignored the correlation between poverty and student performance. Solidly middle-class neighborhoods tend to boast strong educational outcomes. That’s not because teachers magically perform better in some zip codes as compared to others. Instead, much of the educational gap can be attributed to higher teacher workload, inadequate salaries, and a paucity of classroom supplies and school resources. When teachers are too overworked to sit down with a struggling student, who suffers? When schools don’t have enough money to purchase updated textbooks, who has to make do?

7 findings that illustrate racial disparities in education

Liz Sablich
Monday, June 6, 2016






Black people have few enough avenues of income security, and education jobs are one of them. It’s not the salaries that are attractive—those are usually inadequate—but the security net of retirement benefits. If there’s a medical emergency, a divorce, any unexpected big expense, there’s a 401(k) to turn to.
This layer of protection became even more apparent when the subprime mortgage crisis hit, because Black people, of all racial groups, had the greatest proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes. Black Americans had already been hit by housing devaluation due to racism, which extracted wealth from homeowners in majority-Black neighborhoods, and hit again by predatory lending that disproportionately affects Black families. The housing crisis was the final straw, devastating the financial reserves of Black people. According to another EPI report, the median net worth of Black households dropped by 53% between 2005 and 2009, while the net worth of white households dropped by only 17%.
As a former manager of a charter school network in post-Katrina New Orleans, I saw Democratic and Republican reformers together erode labor protections. I regularly heard the complaint that public schools were glorified human resource offices, meaning that schools were more about the adults than the kids. But the fact is that a lot of teaching is about the adults. Kids can’t teach themselves. Problems that the adults in their school face are critical to student outcomes. Reformers wax poetic about caring for children—which is important—but to do that holistically, you have to also care for teachers and students’ families and the lunch lady in the cafeteria. Trying to fix education just by firing teachers—which, by the way, is directly related to teacher overload, and therefore quality of education—doesn’t reflect the way people live.
Because of the backlash that reformers faced when scores of Black educators lost their jobs, and because of the realization that replacing them with younger white hires didn’t solve the problem, the same folks who were on the warpath for Black teaching jobs are now looking to hire more Black teachers. Better late than never, I say.
Research shows that having a Black teacher, in particular, does a lot of good for students, especially minority students. Black students who have one Black teacher by third grade are 7% more likely to graduate high school and 13% more likely to enroll in college. After having two Black teachers, Black students’ likelihood of enrolling in college increases by 32%.
There’s a relevant correlation for you: Hire more Black teachers, and educational outcomes of Black students will improve on their own. This simple action comes with all sorts of attendant benefits for students and the communities they live in. Hire more Black teachers and fund schools in poor and Black districts, and then see how a rising tide lifts all ships. But all of this requires a trust of Black people and their institutions—something that education reform has yet to try at scale.

Hispanic students comprise the largest minority demographic in the nation’s schools, accounting for 26% of students as of 2016. Indeed, the shift in school demographics to a majority-nonwhite student body is largely driven by the growth in the Hispanic population.

Even though Hispanics constitute a major share of the American student population, they continue to face barriers in accessing a quality public education. Many Hispanic students live in poverty or have parents who have not completed high school, attend highly segregated schools, and have a long history of being grouped into low academic tracks.
Because teachers of color serve as role models, and tend to hold higher expectations for students of color, school leaders are increasingly warming to the idea of providing students regular access to teachers who share their ethnic or racial background–including Hispanic students. A growing body of literature demonstrates that students who have demographically similar teachers exhibit better academic outcomes. Most of this research, however, has focused on the relationship between Black teachers and Black students, and there is little empirical evidence on the benefits of ethnic match for Hispanic students.
Two relatively recent studies suggest that Hispanic teachers play a role in Hispanic representation in gifted programs and in STEM courses. Grissom, Rodriguez, and Kern reported that a 10% increase in the share of Hispanic teachers in an elementary school is associated with a 3.1% increase in Hispanic participation in gifted programs. Further, Hispanic student exposure to Hispanic math and science teachers in middle and high school tends to increase the likelihood of Hispanic students taking STEM courses during their freshman year in college.
Today, the Brown Center’s ongoing series on teacher diversity celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month by shedding light on a way in which Hispanic teachers appear to contribute to student outcomes. Following Grissom and colleagues, I merge two nationally representative datasets to explore the relationship between student enrollment in advanced courses and the share of Hispanic teachers. I find that schools with a higher share of Hispanic teachers tend to have a higher percentage of Hispanic students taking Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Though these results do not prove a causal relationship, they suggest a potential channel through which attracting and retaining teachers of color—particularly Hispanic teachers—might benefit students.
AP courses and college outcomes
The AP program was created in the mid-1950s to enable elite high school students to take college-level courses and earn college credit while in high school. The program widely expanded across American high schools in the late 1990s, though gaps in access persist.

Analyzing ‘the homework gap’ among high school students

Michael Hansen and Diana Quintero
Thursday, August 10, 2017






Research on participation in the AP program and subsequent student outcomes reveals that merely taking AP classes is not generally correlated with improved outcomes. However, taking an AP course and passing the exam is associated with a number of positive postsecondary outcomes, including college enrollment, college GPA, and college graduation rates.
Further, selective universities place substantial weight on students’ participation in college-preparatory courses and student GPA (which can be inflated by grades in AP courses). This is particularly important for Hispanic students because they are barely represented in selective universities and these institutions provide higher rates of upward mobility. Consequently, expanding the chances of Hispanic students to get admitted to selective universities is promising for improving Hispanic students’ labor market outcomes.
Hispanic students’ exposure to and participation in AP courses
Before diving into the relationship between Hispanic teachers and Hispanic participation in AP courses, I explore the extent to which Hispanic students are exposed to AP courses and their enrollment rates in such courses.
I use the 2015 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), a national survey of U.S schools that contains information on the number of students enrolled in AP math, AP science, and other AP courses disaggregated by race/ethnicity. Because students typically take AP classes during their junior or senior years, I restrict the sample to schools with students enrolled in those grades (and exclude virtual and alternative schools). The sample comprises nearly 18,000 high schools, 71% of which offer at least one AP course.
The top panel of Figure 1 below shows the percentage of students of each race/ethnicity that attend schools that offer at least one AP course. The overwhelming majority of all students are enrolled in schools that offer AP courses, with relatively little variation across racial/ethnic groups. This broad access is consistent with the efforts of the federal government, states, and The College Board to expand the program across American schools.
Exposure to rigorous courses, however, does not guarantee participation. The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the average percentage of 11th/12th-grade students enrolled in various AP courses among the schools that offer such courses. AP enrollment rates for Hispanic (and Black) students lag far behind those of white and “other race” students (which mostly consists of Asian Americans, the next highest group after Hispanics and Blacks). This might understate the gaps, too, since Hispanic students are more likely to drop out of high school than their white peers.

The CRDC also reports the number of students who took at least one AP exam and the number who passed at least one exam. The figure below shows that participation rates in exams follow a similar pattern to the one observed for taking AP courses. Students in the “other race” category are ahead, while Hispanic and Black students fall behind. Hispanics lag on both participation and passing measures, as only 25% of Hispanic students took at least one exam and 10% passed at least one exam.

Does the share of Hispanic teachers in a school contribute to Hispanic participation in AP courses?
I posit that Hispanic teachers can inspire students to enroll in AP courses. Beyond role modeling and higher expectations, another potential mechanism for this relationship could be through Hispanic teachers raising students’ awareness of the importance of these courses for college admission and subsequent academic outcomes, though this cannot be observed directly.
To estimate the relationship between Hispanic teachers and Hispanic student participation in these rigorous courses, I combined the CRDC sample with the National Teacher and Principal Survey to obtain information on teacher demographics in each school. Following a similar approach to Grissom, Rodriguez, and Kern, I regressed Hispanic students’ AP course participation rates on the percentage of Hispanic teachers in the school, controlling for a set of school factors, including share of minority students, principal’s race, students in poverty, Title I status, school size, school sector, school locale, school district size, and per-pupil expenditure (and state fixed effects).
The results show a positive relationship between the share of Hispanic teachers in a school and the percentage of Hispanic students enrolled in AP courses. A 10-percentage-point increase in the share of Hispanic teachers is associated with a 1.15-percentage-point increase in Hispanic enrollment in AP Math, 1.2 percentage points in AP science, and 2.5 percentage points in AP courses other than AP Math and AP Science. For example, given the current participation rate of Hispanic students in AP Math, an increase in the Hispanic teacher share from 20% to 30% is associated with an increase from 9.3 percent to 10.5 percent in Hispanic enrollment in AP Math.
The share of Hispanic teachers is also correlated with the rate of Hispanic students taking at least one AP exam and, to a lesser extent, the percentage of students passing at least one exam.

A few caveats are in order. The results presented here do not necessarily reflect a causal relationship between Hispanic teachers and Hispanic student participation/success in the AP program. It is possible that other, non-observable factors are driving the relationship, despite my best efforts to control for the relevant variables. Further, the data used in this analysis do not have information on the race/ethnicity of AP teachers specifically—data that would be helpful for identifying mechanisms. For example, it is unclear whether the relationships I observe reflect Hispanic students wanting to sign up for AP courses taught by Hispanic teachers, feeling supported and empowered by having Hispanic teachers more generally (inside or outside of the AP program), or a mixture of both (or neither) of these.
These results suggest that, as policymakers seek to diversify the teaching profession, a better understanding of the many ways in which Hispanic teachers strengthen U.S. public schools is needed. Future research using student-level or longitudinal data is needed to explore the causal impact of Hispanic students being exposed to Hispanic teachers, and whether the effects vary across student grades and outcomes.
In the meantime, let’s express our appreciation for all of the ways that Hispanic teachers enrich America’s schools, hold high expectations for Hispanic students, and contribute to these students’ academic experience in countless ways.
Thanks to Michael Hansen and Jon Valant for their helpful feedback with this analysis.

Last month, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe signed Executive Directive 14 to address the state’s growing teacher shortage and simultaneously announced budget actions to target the recruitment and retention of qualified teachers, particularly teachers of color.
Virginia is not the only state to focus on teacher diversity when attempting to remedy teacher shortages. Last April, the Tennessee Department of Education announced a strategy to address its shortages that included grant funding to districts for developing plans to increase teacher diversity. Teacher and education policy groups in Minnesota have argued for policy remedies that attempt to provide a combined approach to tackling both problems.

These states are all looking to merge two important—though usually separate—conversations about the status of the teacher workforce nationally: teacher shortages and the lack of minority representation among teachers. Addressing these issues with an integrated strategy seems entirely sensible in light of their common focus on the pipeline bringing new teachers into the profession. In this post, the latest in our teacher diversity series, we examine the extent to which these issues overlap in practice.
To begin, it’s helpful to notice the common setting for these staffing issues. Though the extent of the teacher shortage is debated, shortages occur when teaching vacancies are exceptionally difficult to fill or even go unfilled into the school year. Staffing vacancies arise most commonly after teachers have voluntarily left a school—whether it be for a different post elsewhere or due to leaving the profession altogether. This fact alone means that vacancies will be most concentrated in schools with high turnover, which tend to be those schools that serve high-poverty, high-minority student bodies.
These same schools are also important from a workforce diversity angle. The high concentration of minority students implies a higher need for minority teachers in these schools to minimize the incidence of racial mismatch and its effects on students.

The achievement gap in education: Racial segregation versus segregation by poverty

Dick Startz
Monday, January 20, 2020






Due to these common settings for both problems, it is easy to presume that both are closely associated; in other words, schools with shortages need minority teachers most. Therefore, policies to tackle one problem should implicitly tackle the other. But is that actually the case? How are minorities represented in schools most feeling the teacher shortage pinch?
Given existing evidence, unfortunately, it’s unclear whether we should expect shortages in the same places where we expect low shares of minority teachers. On one hand, states with high numbers of hard-to-fill vacancies may promote reforms to licensure policies that result in lower barriers to entry, and presumably a more diverse workforce. Although there is no evidence of a causal relationship between lowering entry barriers and minority representation, minorities have demonstrably lower passage rates on licensure tests (and these lower passage rates do not appear to signal lower quality) and are somewhat less common in states with higher testing standards. Similarly, alternative certification routes like Teach for America are known for being one of the most diverse pathways into the teaching profession. Hence, shortages could pressure states to adopt alternative certification policies that may result in greater minority representation in the workforce. In this case, we may witness increasing workforce diversity in states that recently experienced or are currently experiencing shortages.
On the other hand, hostile or undesirable work environments may induce more teacher turnover, which causes more vacancies that may be difficult to fill. Because recent evidence suggests teachers of color have higher quit rates in the face of low administrative support—particularly when they are significantly under-represented among the school’s teachers—we might predict workforce diversity to be low in places with teacher shortages.
In light of states adopting policies designed to target both issues (shortages and low workforce diversity) simultaneously, we think it’s important to develop a better understanding of whether these problems tend to occur concurrently. To explore the shortage-diversity relationship, we dig into data from the most recent Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a nationally representative survey administered by the National Center for Education Statistics in the Department of Education. The SASS asks schools whether they had a vacancy (by subject), and if so, how easy or hard it was to fill.
Figure 1 plots the share of minority teachers and minority students in schools that report a vacancy in special education, English, social studies, or STEM (combining math, biology, computer science and physical sciences) and in schools without a vacancy in each of those subjects.[1]

Consistent with prior evidence, we find that schools with vacancies had slightly higher shares of minority students. Figure 1 also shows such schools also had slightly higher shares of minority teachers. Additionally, the share of minority teachers looks roughly the same regardless of the subject the vacancy is seeking to hire.
It is also worth noting that the presence of vacancies in a school varies by subject: On the low end, about a quarter of schools reported vacancies in social studies, while more than 45 percent of schools reported a vacancy in a STEM subject.
The above figure treats all vacancies the same, but shortages are marked by the presence of hard-to-staff vacancies. Figure 2 plots the breakdown of schools with vacancies by how easy these vacancies were to fill.

Here we see that schools that had a harder time filling the vacancy have a slightly more diverse student body than schools where it was easy to fill the vacancy. Interestingly, though, minority teacher representation increases in schools with hard-to-fill vacancies. Further, the marginal increase in minority teacher representation in schools with hard-to-fill vacancies is even higher than the analogous increase among minority students across three of the four subject areas (special education excluded). The change in demographics among hard-to-fill social studies posts visually stands out in Figure 2, though these numbers are drawn from a comparatively small sample of schools (51) that fall into that category.
Taking this one step further, in Figure 3 we look across subjects and tabulate the number of hard-to-fill vacancies in particular schools to look for changes in minority representation. We observe similar proportional increases in both teacher and student minority representation as the number of hard-to-fill vacancies goes up in a school (and, presumably, the likelihood of the school feeling like it faces a teacher shortage).

Looking across these data, we offer two concluding comments.
First, we see greater shares of minority students in schools where vacancies (and, presumably, shortages) are more acute. We also find progressively more minority teachers in these schools as well. While schools that had many hard-to-fill vacancies showed larger discrepancies between student and teacher representation (in terms of differences in percentage points), these differences were proportional to representation challenges in other schools. Hence, schools facing shortages—at least from this national perspective—do not show any systematic pattern of minority underrepresentation. Further, schools with many hard-to-fill vacancies had some of the highest teacher minority shares in the analysis. Hiring more minority teachers specifically to these schools would simply concentrate them where they already teach in high numbers.
Second, this evidence suggests the lack of minority representation among the teacher workforce and teacher shortages do not seem to be closely related, at least not spatially. We applaud the efforts of some states to increase teacher diversity and shortages simultaneously, but we should not assume that addressing one problem would implicitly fix the other.

Footnote

We are looking at schools that post and hire teachers to subject-specific vacancies; thus, the sample is primarily (though not exclusively) made up of middle and high schools.

366,/article/idUSKBN2720S3,Beheaded French teacher was target of angry social media campaign,"By Sybille de La Hamaide, Caroline Pailliez4 Min ReadPARIS/CONFLANS-SAINTE-HONORINE, France (Reuters) - Samuel Paty, the teacher beheaded outside his school in a Paris suburb, was described by his pupils and their parents as caring and professional. But he was killed after becoming the target of an angry campaign on social media.People bring flowers to the Bois d'Aulne college after the attack in the Paris suburb of Conflans St Honorine, France, October 17, 2020. REUTERS/Charles PlatiauPaty, 47, was killed on Friday by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin. Prosecutors said the attacker, shot dead by police soon after, wanted to punish the teacher for showing his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class on freedom of expression earlier this month.Parents said they were mystified how the civics class could have escalated into a motive for a gruesome murder.Prosecutors offered a clue on Saturday when they said they detained two men, one the father of a pupil at the school and another on the radar of intelligence services, who they said had used social media to turn a dispute over the civics class into a campaign against the teacher.“I cannot imagine how we got to this point,” said Cécile Ribet Retel, a member of the parent’s association at the school, College du Bois d’Aulne.“This raises questions about the role of social media.Paty had shown his pupils the cartoons last year too, as part of the civics curriculum, according to a 13-year-old pupil who was in that class.The pupil, speaking beside her mother, said no one had made a fuss about the class last year. The teacher, she added, was “very funny”.“He told jokes. He was very engaged in the lessons.”ONLINE CAMPAIGNThe first sign of an issue with year’s civics lesson emerged on Oct. 7 when the parent of a girl who was in the class posted an angry video on Facebook. In it, he said the teacher had shown the cartoons of Mohammad and that his daughter, a Muslim, had been disciplined for expressing her displeasure.The man, not named by officials, said he wanted the teacher removed.The next day, the father went to see the principal of the school to complain, prosecutors said. That evening, he put out another Facebook video, giving the name of the teacher and identifying the school.On Oct. 12, another video appeared on YouTube, featuring the father of the pupil. A man off-camera interviewed the man’s daughter. The voice off-camera said President Emmanuel Macron was inciting hatred of Muslims and threatened a demonstration if the teacher was not removed.The man off-camera was known to intelligence services, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said on Saturday, though he did not say in what capacity. The father of the pupil has a half-sister who in 2014 joined Islamic State in Syria, Ricard said.Both men were detained by police after Paty’s killing.THREATS TO SCHOOLStaff at the school sought to resolve the row. The principal arranged a meeting with those parents unhappy about the civics lesson. The parent who published the Facebook video did not come, prosecutors said.“It went well,” Nordine Chaouadi, who had a child in Paty’s class, said of the meeting. “My wife took part in it. She said it was a man who made a mistake, it happens to everyone. No need to go for all that agitation on social networks.”By Tuesday this week, the principal had succeeded in calming the atmosphere at the school, according to a local official briefed on what happened, who did not want to be identified.By then, though, the issue had escalated.According to prosecutors, the school had been receiving threats since the social media videos started appearing.On Saturday, the day after the teacher’s killing, pupils and parents laid flowers at the school gates.Chahinez Senouci, who has a child at the school, said she used to bump into Paty at school meetings.“He was a teacher who liked the pupils, he was very attentive. He took care that they are following everything properly,” she said. “It’s an enormous shock.”Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Pravin CharOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

373,/article/idUSL8N2HD732,Beheading of teacher exposes secular divide in French classrooms,"By Caroline Pailliez4 Min ReadPARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Some teachers in France say they censor themselves to avoid confrontation with pupils and parents over religion and free speech, a problem brutally exposed when a teacher was beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in class.History teacher Samuel Paty had shown the images mocking the Prophet in a lesson on freedom of expression, pictures first published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2006 that led to a deadly Islamist attack on its offices.Paty’s murder earlier this week has caused outrage in a country where the separation of church and state is fiercely defended by many. It has also exposed divisions in a society where a large Muslim community feels its beliefs are not properly respected.Those fault lines, if anything, have got stronger over the last 10-20 years, said Delphine Girard, who started teaching in 2004, the year France banned the wearing of Islamic headscarves in schools.“It’s as if the students are the mouthpiece for thinking that does not come from them ... but from people who want to impose a religious identity that keeps getting a little stronger.”The self-censorship takes many forms: from primary school teachers who chose not to read their class the tale of Three Little Pigs for fear of a backlash from some Muslim parents, to history teachers who said they avoid religious satire.State secularism, or “laicité” is central to France’s national identity and demands the separation of religion and public life.Schools have historically instilled the Republic’s values in its citizens - a task some teachers say becomes ever harder as a minority of French Muslims and adherents of other faiths seek to express their religious identity.“I self-censored a lot on issues around laicité,” said a teacher previously employed at a Paris high school who asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions. “I felt a real hatred for French values.”Her experiences meant that while Paty’s killing was devastating, it was not entirely a surprise.Recalling the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, she said she had avoided discussing it the next day with her students.“We held a minute’s silence and I moved on. I was cowardly.”SACRED VALUESSecularism was enshrined in French law in 1905 after anti-clerical struggles with the Catholic Church. In recent decades, the desire among some French Muslims to express their religious identity has dominated the debate around balancing religious and secular needs.Some teachers said that in the banlieues - the deprived suburbs that ring French cities - the list of delicate topics on the curriculum was constantly expanding and blamed families and local communities for influencing youngsters.The government said it knew there was a problem with self-censorship among teachers, spokesman Gabriel Attal told reporters this week.France’s national curriculum sets out the framework and directs teachers towards websites that suggest teaching materials and lesson plans. For lessons on freedom of expression for 13-year-olds, the same class Paty had taught, the Charlie Hebdo cartoons are a common suggestion.“Caricatures are not Mein Kampf,” said history teacher Maxime Reppert, referring to Hitler’s Nazi manifesto. “They are not a call to incite hate.”In an emotional tribute to Paty on Wednesday, President Emmanuel Macron said France would defend its values and protect its teachers. Pressure, abuse and ignorance had no place in France, he said.Many teachers want more concrete reassurances from Macron and his government when the October half-term holiday ends.“Should I bring this up with my students when they return, with a caricature of the Prophet to hand,” said an art teacher who withheld her name from publication.Silence, she continued, might be worse.“Today I am afraid. But even more so of what could become of such horrors if we let this fear interfere in the debate.”Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Giles ElgoodOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Executive Summary
Even before signing the Paris climate agreement, the Indian government announced extremely ambitious renewable energy (RE) targets  that would quadruple the country’s RE capacity between late 2014 and 2022, to 175 gigawatts (GW).1

	 From India’s relatively small RE base, this target implies annual growth of 25 percent—a targeted buildout rate even faster than China’s, which is widely seen as the world’s leader in deploying RE. However, a set of political and economic contradictions are built into this ambitious plan. These contradictions reveal how policymaking and implementation work in India and why visions for change often don’t become reality.
At the center of India’s contradictions are two core facts.
The first fact is that investment has created a vibrant and competitive RE market in India. The private sector is central in building most new RE capacity—it has developed aggressive financing mechanisms and is mobilizing massive amounts of capital. The RE industry is a heavily Indian affair. Foreign capital has not rushed in, thanks to costly foreign currency hedging and wariness about securing contracts and steady payments. But the RE business has risen in magnitude and power.
The other core fact is that RE faces a host of challenges, some particularly acute in or unique to India. RE cannot yet compete against most existing coal-fired generation, which remains the dominant source of power in India. Grid-scale solar and wind projects have found bids as low as 2.4 rupees per kilowatt-hour (about 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, or kWh),2 a 70 percent decline in just a few years. Falling RE costs have inspired discussions of “grid parity”—an imagined moment when RE will push coal off the Indian grid. That moment is still far in the future when one includes the full costs of integrating RE into the grid. We find that the best performing RE systems, with aggressive assumptions about the cost of integration, are competitive with the most expensive new coal projects, but not with existing coal plants.
Another key challenge is that India’s grid and utilities are weak. The electricity distribution companies (DisComs), almost all owned and controlled by state governments, play central roles. Most DisComs are struggling financially in ways that can lead them to delay payments, renegotiate power purchase agreements (PPAs), or avoid signing new PPAs.
The difficulties of integrating RE into India’s power grid will worsen as RE’s share of generation increases, causing disproportionate strain on states rich in RE resources. Other sources of generation—notably coal—will need to back down to accommodate rising yet variable RE generation. RE integration would be easier across larger balancing areas within the grid, but that approach would require substantial investments in long-distance RE-centric transmission, which have been limited so far. Energy storage could help, and we project the need for massive new storage capabilities at acceptable cost starting in the early to mid-2020s. However, a roadmap for obtaining affordable storage is also elusive.

Despite these sobering facts, the Indian government has repeatedly emphasized that its RE goals are the core of its energy policy. This insistence remains despite growing evidence that India does not need to meet its RE targets to achieve its goals under the Paris climate agreement. This contradiction persists because of the politics of RE in India. The central government sees RE as a vehicle for building new industries and rewiring investment incentives in the power grid, and as an extension of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi achieved when he was chief minister of Gujarat, a pro-business state in India that became a beacon for private sector-led shifts to renewable and cleaner power, not to mention an improved electricity grid.
Yet consumers are largely indifferent to renewables and concerned much more about electricity cost and reliability. The political power of coal also remains strong, along with the power of the railroads that earn much of their revenue from moving coal. RE’s impact on coal has been relatively limited thus far. Coal remains the dominant supply source, and is likely to grow at approximately 4 percent per year in terms of generation through 2030, a high growth rate in absolute terms, but lower than the past.3
Within this context, the central government has led by announcing bold goals for RE while failing to create the political, policy, and regulatory conditions that allow those goals to become reality. States often express hostility to rapid RE growth. Areas with high RE growth are likely to face high costs, especially when factoring in the impact on the rest of the grid. The states lag the central government in RE ambitions, and do not have Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) that add up to the national targets.
How did these contradictions emerge and persist? First, India’s energy planning is rooted in years of scarcity, with more supply seen as the answer to all problems. Second, a silo-based approach across generation sources, rather than a portfolio-based approach, informed policy design and execution. This was exacerbated by a target-oriented approach (following Soviet-styled 5-Year-Plans, instead of a market-oriented system that allowed realistic signaling). Such a focus on adding generation worked, more or less, in the past, but recent growth of generation capacity and lower electricity demand growth changes the entire calculus. The question today is not one of sufficient energy, but of energy available at the right time and place with the right characteristics, such as ramping and predictability. RE is particularly disruptive in a power system designed for large, centralized supply.
Looking to the future, growing RE’s share of generation will require institutional and regulatory actions to reduce the cost of grid integration. New market incentives are needed to create the right types of supply based on location, seasonal or daily availability, and ramping capabilities. Particularly important is a focus on the DisComs, which are a weak link in the existing system and quite vulnerable to disruption. The highest paying commercial and industrial customers are among the biggest investors in rooftop solar resources. An even bigger push toward RE by these important customers could accelerate the downward spiral of DisCom finances.
The world is watching India’s transition to cleaner energy. Many are ready to support the growth of RE, particularly at the expense of coal. However, India’s RE ambitions should be viewed not in terms of specific targets and numbers, but broader trends. Holistic policies will accelerate the transition.

On June 25, the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate hosted a discussion on the new dynamics of global energy, featuring International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol, in conversation with Initiative Co-Chair David G. Victor. Among its core themes was, as Birol aptly described, “geopolitics is back to energy.”

In opening, Victor reflected on how the energy “world is now transforming,” adding, “we’re looking at tremendous changes in costs … in the electric power sector—potentially, a complete transformation of the grid,” along with the opportunities and risks this presents.

Transformation in the energy sector is shifting geopolitics
During the discussion, Birol outlined four transformative shifts—“energy upheavals,” he called them—that he viewed as driving the major changes underway in the global energy system:
1China is changing, and moving toward cleaner energy
China is changing the game in global energy markets, especially in clean energy. Due to shifts in its domestic energy consumption and production in recent years, China has grown to become the number one producer of solar and wind energy in the world. Moreover, its choices in the coming decades will greatly influence global trajectories in energy production, and, in greenhouse gas emissions.
2Clean energy is becoming cheaper
Birol observed how some renewable energy sources—particularly wind and solar—are becoming cost-competitive with fossil energy resources, even “becoming the cheapest source of electricity generation in many emerging countries.” Despite remaining challenges with grid integration, Birol remarked, “Renewables are not, anymore, a romantic story.”
3The U.S. energy boom is shifting global energy markets and geopolitics
As IEA analyses predicted several years ago, increases in U.S. oil and gas production are beginning to shift the politics of global energy. Birol explained, “The U.S. is a major producer, a major exporter … and has changed the role of the global energy markets, and, as such, the established role of the traditional exporters [the Organization of Exporting Petroleum Countries, or OPEC] has changed.” Continuing, he added, “The U.S. will be the undisputed leader in oil and gas production for many years,” noting that the “implications will be felt from the trade floors, to the geopolitics of energy.”

4The electrification of the global energy system
Birol described how electricity demand is growing at a rate two times faster than overall energy demand, driven primarily by the expansion of electricity access in emerging economies. In discussing electrification, Birol noted how rising electricity demand in India and China could alter and “lock in” the trajectory of our technological systems for decades to come.
Victor reflected that ripe among the political rhetoric in Washington is the Trump administration’s theme of “energy dominance.” Here, Birol argued, as the United States begins to take on a larger role in energy exports, it could begin to wield its newfound energy abundance as a foreign policy lever.
“Geopolitics is back to energy.”
Victor and Birol also discussed the role of increasing diversification of countries’ energy sectors and economies, and accompanying geopolitical implications. Several countries traditionally heavily reliant on oil and gas revenues to fill their coffers are now seeking energy reforms, as did Mexico. So, too, are countries eager to diversify not only the types of energy they use, but also their sources, to reduce reliance on any single country or grouping of countries.
Changing data Trends
Birol additionally detailed two shifting trends in global energy data:

Climate change: Following a period of leveling off of global carbon dioxide emissions (one of the major greenhouse gases contributing to climate change) between 2014 and 2016, the following year, global carbon dioxide emissions again began to rise. Birol stressed, “If we want to be on track with our scenarios … [and the temperature goals of the Paris climate agreement], we have to see a peak of the emissions very soon. The idea was 2020s.” Still, he and Victor were pessimistic about this possibility, reflecting on how this window is rapidly closing, particularly as newly committed projects begin to “lock in” future emissions. In Birol’s view, “huge technological breakthroughs or huge political breakthroughs” are needed. Perhaps more optimistic about addressing methane emissions (another potent greenhouse gas) from natural gas, Birol stated, “Half of the emissions from methane—that we can get rid of at no cost—is equal to the emissions of two-thirds of coal plants in Asia.” He also discussed efforts underway at the IEA to explore the role that carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies could play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.
Energy access: IEA examines global energy access and its distribution about the world. Birol commented on progress made in both China and India in this regard, with China having achieved universal access previously, and India expanded access to all villages as of April 2018. He noted, however, that considerable efforts remain in sub-Saharan Africa, where two out of three people still lack energy access.

“If we want to be on track with our scenarios… [and the temperature goals of the Paris climate agreement], we have to see a peak of the emissions very soon. The idea was 2020s.”
Moving Forward
Birol closed the discussion remarking, “Some of the challenges we have today are so huge, and so immediate—imminent challenges—that if we want to address those challenges, there is a need for a collective public answer. We are not in a position to leave everything to the market. … Together with the private sector, together with the energy industry … I see a leadership role from the public institutions badly needed here.”

Organizations, news outlets, and activists are focused on increasing attention to the growing climate crisis. On September 23, the United Nations Climate Action Summit happens in New York, part of the UN General Assembly meeting. In this edition of Charts of the Week, a look at some research related to energy and climate.
Coal declining, natural gas rising as US electricity sources 
In a report titled, “The Risk of Fiscal Collapse in Coal-Reliant Communities,” expert authors from Brookings and the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University examine risks to the 53,000 U.S. workers and their communities employed in the coal industry. As they show, over 80% of U.S.-coal was used in electricity generation, but the share of overall electricity generated from coal is steadily declining. 

COAL DOMINATES INDIA’S POWER SUPPLY
Coal remains the dominant source of electricity power generation in India. Rahul Tongia and Samantha Gross write that “Despite expected growth in RE [renewable energy], we project that coal will remain the dominant fuel for electricity generation in India through 2030 and beyond, even though its share of generation will fall.” In their paper, the authors examine India’s use of coal, and its aims to increase alternative sources of energy to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.
 
US CLIMATE COSTS WILL BE WIDESPREAD BUT UNEVEN BY CENTURY’S END 
A team of Brookings researchers examine the geography of climate change with the help of county-level data from the Climate Impact Lab. The data include assessments of climate-change impact in various areas, including agriculture, mortality, coastal damage, and labor supply risk. The chart below aggregates these factors. The researchers conclude, among other things, that mortality represents the largest cause of the variability, and also climate change could “bestow net economic benefits” to some areas of the country.

387,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/31/reviving-energy-cooperation-in-south-asia/,Reviving energy cooperation in South Asia,"
In this edition, Saheb Singh Chadha interviews Dr. Mirza Sadaqat Huda on his book “Energy Cooperation in South Asia: Utilising Natural Resources for Peace and Sustainable Development”, published in April 2020 by Routledge.
Recent developments in South Asian energy security such as the India-Nepal petroleum products pipeline and the India-Bhutan joint venture hydroelectric project have revived conversations on energy cooperation in the region. While these projects are a welcome development, like many others before, they have experienced logistical, bureaucratic, or political delays.
In this context, Mirza Sadaqat Huda’s book offers unique insights into addressing the underlying problems in regional energy cooperation. Based on his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Queensland, the book uses four case studies (the Tipaimukh Dam, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) Pipeline, the Myanmar-Bangladesh-India (MBI) Pipeline, and the Bhutan-Bangladesh-India-Nepal (BBIN) sub-regional grouping) to layout four distinct frameworks for energy cooperation, offering learnings on how challenges of a similar nature can be overcome in future projects.
Saheb Chadha: Your book describes India as a “hydro-hegemon” in the chapter on BBIN cooperation. Could you elaborate on the term and how it has contributed to distrust among India’s neighbours?
Mirza Huda: The term hydro-hegemony is used to describe a situation where power disparities between members of a shared river basin results in the maintenance of the status quo on water allocation. More powerful members of shared river basins, such as Egypt in the Nile and Turkey in the Euphrates-Tigris Basins use a range of strategies, such as coercion, resource capture, and inequitable treaties to control water resources.
In South Asia, India has used its relative advantage in military and economic power to dominate regional interactions on water sharing. Historically, India has only agreed to cooperate on a bilateral level on water issues, despite Nepal and Bangladesh’s preference for multilateral, basin-wide cooperation on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Basin (GBM). Some analysts have argued that India has preferred to engage bilaterally in order to maximise on disparities in size and power.
Due to the politicised nature of interactions on water sharing, the focus of existing bilateral agreements is on establishing sovereign rights over water, rather than the collective development of shared resources. This reductionist approach cannot address climate change and extreme weather events, which is set to drastically change the ecology of the GBM Basin. During my fieldwork in Nepal I spoke to several policymakers who argued that the political and ecological repercussions of India’s hydro-hegemonic policies can undermine the development of BBIN hydroelectric projects.
In my book, I have proposed an Environmental Peacebuilding framework for informing the planning processes of BBIN hydroelectric projects. I argue that policies conceptualised from an environmental peacebuilding framework can resolve some of the environmental challenges to BBIN hydroelectric projects and have a transformative impact on regional politics by incentivising integration and reducing conflicts.
I suggest a policy mechanism by which the ‘high politics’ of energy security can be linked to the ‘low politics’ environmental cooperation, thereby facilitating energy security, multilateral river basin management, and peacebuilding. Since the 2018 guidelines of the Indian power ministry have formalised multilateral cooperation on electricity trade, hydroelectric cooperation can be an important entry point towards integrated river basin management of the GBM.
SC: You suggest a ‘peace-building approach’ to energy diplomacy that engages both energy security and conflict resolution imperatives. How do you think this differs from the current practice of diplomacy in the region?
MH: South Asia’s regional geopolitics is determined by the conflation of identity, politics, and international borders. Almost every conflict in South Asia – be it the Kashmir issue, the Kalapani dispute, or deadly confrontations between Bangladeshi citizens and the Border Security Force (BSF) of India are rooted in the region’s messy borders. Due to the history of the partition, borders are both a physical and social construct, looming large in domestic-level ethnic and religious conflicts. Transnational energy projects would thus engage with multiple social and ideational issues rooted in South Asia’s borders.
Before implementing cross border infrastructure projects, policymakers should identify the direct and indirect objectives of these initiatives. In my opinion, the goal of cross-border infrastructure in a conflictual region like South Asia should not be confined to the enhancement of energy security. We must also perceive energy projects as mechanisms of conflict resolution. In other words, energy projects should be deliberately designed to facilitate integration and peacebuilding. In my book, I argue that currently, cross-border energy projects are perceived only as conduits of resources that are vital to national security. I call this the ‘national security approach to energy diplomacy’.

In the last seven years, India’s renewed enthusiasm for regional energy cooperation in South Asia has led to concrete progress on multiple cross-border energy projects. However, New Delhi’s enthusiasm for South Asian integration after years of neglect has been marked by a paradoxical assertion of hard borders and ethno-nationalism, which creates significant concerns for the sustainability of cross-border energy projects. The regional repercussions of India’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and the continuation of insurgencies in Pakistan and Afghanistan have contributed to the entrenchment of ultra-nationalism and ethnic and religious cleavages.
SC: Your book highlights the potential of extending the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, such as TAPI-B to Bangladesh, as well as keeping the interests of local communities and other external powers in mind. Do you feel this might complicate negotiations and perhaps stall progress?
MH: An increased number of stakeholders can indeed create complexity in an energy project. However, in security-obsessed South Asia where elite actors dictate discourses on development, it is fundamental that a broader group of stakeholders are involved in the cross-border energy projects. In my book, I have argued that one of the fundamental challenges to the realisation of the TAPI pipeline is that existing policy discourse has focused almost exclusively on the national security interests of the four countries involved in the project. This limited perspective has perpetuated the orthodox, defence-centric perception of energy and undermined the realisation of pipeline projects.
In security-obsessed South Asia where elite actors dictate discourses on development, it is fundamental that a broader group of stakeholders are involved in the cross-border energy projects.
Interview respondents from India and Pakistan told me that the ‘securitisation’ of pipelines is one of the fundamental challenges to their implementation. In my book, I suggest a framework for de-securitising the TAPI pipeline, which takes into account the interests of regional countries, extra-regional powers, international organisations and most importantly, that of local community members. Firstly, I argue that the TAPI can be deliberately designed to converge the interests of regional countries and external powers. I suggest a number of policy interventions that can be undertaken to encourage inclusive cooperation between state-level actors, energy companies, and institutions. Secondly, I undertake a comparative analysis of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline (BTC) to identify ways by which the interests of local communities that live along the route of the TAPI can be addressed via socio- economic programmes and effective social and environmental governance. This can reduce the explicit emphasis on the physical security of the pipeline by including human security concerns within the project’s blueprint. My conclusion is that taking into account a broader group of stakeholders can create a shift in the perception of the TAPI from a defence and security realm to that of inclusive cooperation.
SC: The construction of a Chinese pipeline in the same region as the Myanmar-Bangladesh-India (MBI) pipeline raises questions about resource constraints for a second pipeline. Does this also impose any political constraints, due to the Sino-Indian competition in South Asia?
MH: Finite resources are not only an impediment to the revitalisation of the MBI but can also impede the TAPI. China has been very successful in constructing pipelines in Myanmar and Central Asia. Technological developments and the discovery of new reserves can increase the supply of available resources in these regions. However, geopolitical conflicts between India and China, as exemplified by the tragic incident in Ladakh, can complicate transnational energy projects. Some South Asian policymakers I spoke to suggested that cooperation between India and China on securing international energy resources can result in economic benefits for both countries. Unfortunately, the political repercussions of the COVID 19 pandemic and territorial conflicts between India and China will prevent any substantial cooperation between the two countries on energy in the near future.
SC: In your chapter about the Tipaimukh dam, you outlined the feasibility of the ‘Cooperative Security Approach’ and ‘Share the resources’ model. Postcolonial states, including South Asian countries, tend to prize the resources in their territory and their ownership over them. How much of a challenge is this mindset in reducing the ‘Sovereignty Based Approach’ and ‘Divide the resources’ model?
MH: South Asia as a region must collectively address climate change and energy insecurity. Yet, a regional approach to these critical challenges is undermined by resource nationalism. For decades, bilateral agreements on water in the region have only focused on dividing resources. Collective action on resource development has been mentioned almost as afterthoughts in these agreements and has never seen concrete implementation. In my book, I argue that for South Asia to transition from dividing to sharing resources, there needs to be a change in the way resources are conceptualised and how costs and benefits are shared.
One of the persistent issues that I encountered in my research is that people in a particular region or country are unhappy if local resources are used to generate energy in another area. To address this issue, politicians must change the way they communicate key messages to their citizenry regarding natural resources. In my book, I argue that politicians often talk about the total cost of resources, but not the total benefits that can be derived from exploiting these resources. For example, in the early 2000s, political discourse on energy security in Bangladesh focused almost exclusively on the total amount of gas reserves in the country. This led to resource nationalism, resulting in the shelving of a gas trade deal between India and Bangladesh. However, instead of discussing the total cost of gas reserves, if politicians and wider intelligentsia in Bangladesh discussed the potential benefits from the exploitation of these reserves towards poverty alleviation and socio-economic development, it could have led to broader consensus on the need for regional cooperation on energy.
 
People in a particular region or country are unhappy if local resources are used to generate energy in another area.
Of course, such messages need to be followed up by the development of benefit-sharing mechanisms as well as resettlement and rehabilitation plans for those who stand to be adversely affected by energy projects. While I use the example of gas trade, similar communication strategies and benefit and compensation policies can create broader consensus on the need to collectively harness the hydroelectric potential of South Asia’s rivers. Overall, astute political leadership is fundamental to creating broad consensus on ecological interdependence in South Asia.

Introduction
On July 1, 2018, Mexicans will select their next president. As of early June 2018, polls show that the candidate of the left, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has built a significant lead, founded on a public backlash against corruption and a feeling that the establishment has failed—sentiments at the core of other populist backlash elections in recent years. Indeed, almost half of Mexicans polled indicate that they will vote against the current party in power.1

At question is whether this public resentment will also unravel some of the signature accomplishments of the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto, including a quiet, steady effort to reform Mexico’s energy markets and roll back the monopolies of Mexico’s state-owned energy companies. These energy reforms have already triggered substantial benefits, such as contracts that could yield $200 billion in investments in the coming years.2 But those benefits, for the most part, are not visible or tangible to average Mexicans.
Until now, nobody has really known what Mexican voters think about all this change. Yet those attitudes matter because the contending candidates for the presidency have outlined starkly different visions for the future. In March 2018, we ran—in tandem with The Brookings Institution, the University of California at San Diego, the global consultancy IHS Markit, and a leading Mexican newspaper, El Financiero—the first systematic poll of Mexican voter attitudes on energy reforms. This paper explains the results of the poll, key insights, and policy lessons.3
What we found is important and disturbing. The poll suggests a substantial risk that what has become perhaps the most ambitious energy reform program undertaken in any country in such a short period of time could be delayed or even diverted. The Mexican public has little knowledge of the crisis that precipitated the need for energy reform, believes that the energy reform has not produced positive results, and distrusts private investment in the energy sector. Despite all that, a modest majority of Mexicans still favor continuing with the country’s energy reforms, rather than rolling them back. Many of the broad insights from our poll transcend national borders:

Public support wanes when the costs of reform are immediate, but the benefits take years to materialize.
The public is quick to latch on to populist promises that benefit them personally, with little attention to who pays for delivering the promises.
Public myths around resource nationalism—and the evils of private investment—are hard to break once entrenched in the public consciousness, including in Mexico, a country with an open economy and a legacy of free trade agreements.
Still, consumers can be very pragmatic, welcoming private competition and imported commodities if they provide the best value for the money.

These insights also offer lessons for public and corporate policy:

Active efforts to create clarity on the cost and timeline to benefit from reforms—even if they complicate consensus-building at the outset—can help avoid the unraveling of support from unmet expectations. Politicians need to address constituencies forthrightly to shape expectations.
Once public disappointment in reforms is rooted in personal experience, reshaping the public outlook may require alternative positive personal experiences—for example, retail supplier competition delivering better quality gasoline or ensuring that a liter bought is a liter delivered at the pump. Government promises that conflict with people’s personal experiences have little credibility.
National benefits and timelines must be made concrete. For instance, politicians could highlight the oil and gas contracts awarded, timelines for exploration and production, power auctions completed, and contracted prices to supply electricity—actions that make credible the flow of future benefits.
Populist myths—such as the idea that setting low gasoline and electricity prices has no cost—are hard to puncture when the public wants to believe them. Not challenging them ensures they will persist. To effectively challenge such myths, the alternative benefits must be tangible and personal: new jobs, better service, fuel or power supplies where and when the public needs them.

India, like other countries, had an ongoing energy transition, but the question becomes will COVID-19 create a pause or a shift in the trajectories?  Or, will it induce radical change? No one can know for sure, in part because we don’t know what the “new normal” will be, but also because timeframes are critical to this puzzle. In the short run, India imposed the world’s most stringent lockdown against COVID-19.  There is a long period of recovery expected, with not just a recession but also shifts in spending patterns, with hits to tourism (~10% of GDP), luxury items, and even discretionary purchases.

The underlying issues
A crisis doesn’t just create new challenges, it sharpens existing challenges. If it pushes a system off the precipice, the factors that got us to the edge are key to understanding what might happen in the future. India’s 2019 WEF Transition Index Ranking was middle-of-the-pack, but this score masked some important details. First, coal, which is half of India’s energy, is being replaced by renewable energy (at least for most new electricity), and in the longer run, there was a move towards electrifying mobility (EVs). India’s Renewable Energy (RE) ambitions are actually amongst the most aggressive in the world, but the short-term target of 175 GW Renewable Energy (RE) by 2022 announced in 2014-15 appeared “easy” both in the sense that it wouldn’t require major grid upgrades or storage and it’s aligned with the new business-as-usual based on cheap RE prices, especially for solar power.
While the AC electrical grid always has to be in real-time balance between demand and supply, India’s financial balance was always precarious, with loss-making distribution utilities at the end of the chain.  Social welfare redistribution has long been a key aspect of energy policy, where commercial and industrial users overpaid to cross-subsidise homes and agriculture.  This entire model is at risk after COVID-19, forget during the lockdown, where overall demand is down 25%. For example, TCS, India’s largest IT company, plans to have 75% of their people working-from-home by 2025.
What COVID-19 changes
The immediate challenge is one of financial liquidity.  Analysts expect the annual losses of the distribution companies (Discoms) to double to about $15 billion.  Cash will be scarce, and new investments will face more hurdles.  The only recent generation investments were in RE, and these may also be at risk, more so as they were about capital over labour.  Out of the labour component, much of it was elsewhere based on manufacturing.  Imports dominate solar modules, with 88% of imports coming from China.

India
Impact of temperature on electricity demand: Evidence from Delhi and Indian states

Rahul Tongia
Monday, March 30, 2020





India already was grappling with surplus generation capacity and stressed assets. Decisions for adding new firm (non-RE) capacity were already a few years away, and these decisions are likely pushed out even further thanks to COVID-19. The earlier equilibrium had about 90% of power coming from static power purchase agreements (PPAs), but demand is way down. While the power exchanges (a small fraction of total supply) now have very low prices, PPAs have limited the value of cheap third party supply, unless DisComs claim force majeure, the new buzzword.  On the other hand electricity remains a notified essential service, and cannot be switched off.  The need for Discom cash flows may also give impetus to innovative technologies, especially accelerated smart metering. It’s ironic that labour (in a land of 1.3 billion people) is again viewed as a bottleneck.
While reforms, the dual of a transition, were also underway, COVID-19 may create counter forces as well.  First, economics and financial engineering were overcoming older lenses of energy security (most explicit in oil and gas), but the pandemic has made all countries worry about supply chains, strategic capabilities, etc.
Imports from China are just one concern, but there is also a renewed push for Make in India, a central government programme to boost manufacturing but one that is implicitly about jobs.  An employment lens suggests more coal (which is mostly domestic, especially thermal coal, as opposed to metallurgical coal). India may finally focus stimulus money on strategic investments not just for RE but for batteries, key to both EVs and high penetrations of RE.
Being more speculative, it’s possible that we’ll lose some competition and even innovation. As Winston Churchill said, “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” In the post-Covid era, it’s likely that the big (and public sector) will survive, or even thrive, with access to funds, scale, and even technology. The small and niche may also thrive, but India’s informal economy, the majority of employment, hasn’t been globally competitive.  In the new world, it may not need to be.
Ensuring a just transition
Clean skies from the lockdown may make people want “clean” as part of the transition, but obviously not at such a high human cost. This exemplifies the real challenge of the transition – handling winners and losers.  India can’t pay off the losers, and so it will require deeper change.
Proposed amendments to the Electricity Act 2003 give a glimpse of bold reforms needed to change the status quo. If subsidies are now to be given to end-consumers directly, they should pay “full cost” for their electricity, which is a sea-change.  Overall, India should make social welfare objectives more direct and explicit, perhaps as a line item in consumer bills. This would make it easier to use separate funds (including stimulus money) for these.  Else, policies ostensibly in the name of the poor simply have led to systemic inefficiency and poor targeting.
Say we have no more greenfield coal power plants built.  This still means by 2030 about half the electricity comes from coal. So we have to clean up coal, not wish it away. India will have to find the funding and the instruments to pay for things like cleaning up emissions from coal power plants. Maybe India could consider adding new ultra-super-critical coal plants when required to shutter older and dirtier plants even before they reach their end-of-life.
It’s too early to predict if we’ll have deep structural change – but even if we don’t, the next one or two years will not be a continuation of the past. Planning under extreme uncertainty may be the real need, across jurisdictions, domains, and ministries, not to mention across public and private.  This is made more complex due to the long lifespans of many investments, not just in generation capacity but the broader ecosystem of transportation, natural resources, and consumption.
India was already undergoing change. Some of the needed reforms, on pricing, regulation, risk allocation, and market design, were pending or pushed back in the past, mostly because they were politically unpopular. Maybe this is the time for taking even tougher decisions than in the past.

In recent years, solar power has surged to become the cheapest and fastest-growing source of electricity on the planet. Over the last decade, solar installations have grown annually by over 30 percent on average, thanks to costs that have plunged more than 90 percent. This red-hot growth suggests that in the near future, solar power could challenge fossil fuel dominance and help the world reduce its carbon emissions. As a result, solar has become the poster child of a putative clean energy revolution.1

Yet such a revolution is in fact a long way off. Fossil fuels still supply most of the world’s energy needs. Today, solar power provides just 2 percent of the world’s electricity, and the generation of electricity, in turn, accounts for just a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. To avert catastrophic climate change, the world will have to nearly eliminate its emissions shortly after midcentury—a goal known as deep decarbonization—which will require the most ambitious overhaul of the world’s energy infrastructure in human history.
The danger is that a broad constellation of increasingly powerful political interests—buoyed by the rise of the global solar industry—might not support the farsighted public policies needed for the world to achieve deep decarbonization. At first blush, this is counterintuitive. The political interests allied with the fossil fuel industry are much more obvious culprits in delaying the shift away from a carbon-intensive energy mix. By contrast, far from thwarting decarbonization, ascendant backers of solar energy would appear to be well placed to further promote solar power and advance a clean energy transition.
That intuitive and happy outcome might indeed come to pass. But there are warning signs that coalitions of solar advocates might channel some of their political influence toward pressuring governments around the world to enact policies that would make deep decarbonization more expensive and complicated. Such advocacy coalitions—spanning interests from industry, civil society, and political organizations—might appear united in pushing for renewable energy deployment to combat climate change, but actually harbor a variety of political goals that diverge from global decarbonization.

Three examples of public policies that might impede long-term decarbonization—but nonetheless are backed by the solar industry or its political allies—raise concerns about the political power unleashed by solar power’s rise. First, in countries including Germany and the United States, some environmental groups are pressuring policymakers to shut down nuclear reactors, even though nuclear energy and another unpopular energy source, fossil fuel plants equipped to capture carbon emissions, are important elements of a pragmatic decarbonization strategy. Second, the U.S. advocacy coalition that once supported both innovation in and deployment of solar energy now mostly supports deployment, content to leave underfunded the innovations needed to harness solar power’s full potential. And third, factions of the solar industry across the developed and developing worlds have all lobbied, with some success, for barriers to free trade of solar components, which make it more costly to deploy solar power.
That solar advocates might not push for optimal decarbonization policies is not surprising. Some advocates, such as environmental groups, have a range of goals, such as local environmental protection, that often clash with the imperatives of global decarbonization. And the solar industry, like any other, has its own interests, which it has sought to advance by organizing politically and recruiting a diverse coalition of allies. Yet what is narrowly good for solar power in the short term is not necessarily broadly good for global decarbonization or even, for that matter, the long-term growth of solar power. Indeed, without political support for a more flexible and reliable power grid, for example, the progress of both solar deployment and emissions reductions could stall.
To be sure, the great success of advocacy coalitions in persuading governments to pass policies supportive of solar power has enabled the breakneck growth of the solar industry. Moreover, the support of these coalitions could be important to pass sensible climate policies, such as carbon pricing regimes, that solar advocates generally favor. Therefore, policymakers should aim to harness the increasing political influence of these actors to advance policies conducive to deep decarbonization. At the same time, they should recognize that some suboptimal, inefficient policies are unavoidable and even desirable if they enable a broader policy portfolio that is sensible on balance. For their part, the solar industry and its political allies should look beyond narrow advocacy for near-term solar incentives and back policies to create the flexible, decarbonized energy systems that will enable solar power’s long-term success.

In “Undiplomatic Action” David G. Victor and Bruce D. Jones explore the changing landscape of climate diplomacy and pathways forward in driving on-the-ground energy transitions and technological innovation. In the first of the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate paper series, they write, “The underlying facts surrounding practical deployment of new technologies are what drive changes in emissions, political preferences, and how national governments assess national interests.”

In the piece, Victor and Jones outline four key priorities for advancing the low-carbon energy transition:

Focus on the actors that matter, and work with them in small groups;
Focus on high-leverage emissions: short-lived climate pollutants;
Focus on high-leverage technologies: deep decarbonization will require technological transformation; and
Build foundations for better governance.

“Shifting the focus to niches, to innovation, to small groups that can drive action–all of this is part of creating the conditions under which it is realistic to shift policy, both national and global, through which deep transformation of energy systems will occur.”

Executive summary

A view gaining ground in the West holds that China’s determined dominance of a range of low-carbon industries, from more-efficient coal combustion to solar and wind power to electric vehicles, threatens the national security of developed nations and the fortunes of their firms. That view is outdated, ill-advised, and overdue for a rethink. China’s clean-energy juggernaut—call it Green China Inc.—is growing up. The West, for its own economic good, should grow up too in its approach to Green China Inc.
Green China Inc. is maturing both because the Chinese economy is maturing and because the global push for cleaner energy is as well. The upshot is a global shift to greener growth, with China leading the way. This shift defines a new era in the business of energy and thus in geopolitics. It ought, too, to define a new era in the West’s approach to Green China Inc.—one that, for the long haul, actually serves the West’s economic self-interest, to say nothing of the planet’s health.
Crucial to a new approach should be a rejection of what traditionally have been dubbed “protectionist” policies, billed as propping up domestic players by keeping foreign competitors at bay. Those policies have had spotty records throughout the economy, but they are particularly ill-suited to the clean-energy sector.
To be sure, the geostrategic kernel of the Western worry about Green China Inc. contains grains of legitimacy. But the West’s anxiety about Green China Inc. is prompting a variety of wrongheaded responses. One is a trade war in which the United States imposes tariffs on imported Chinese clean-energy products and China retaliates with tariffs against U.S. goods. As of this writing, in mid-2019, the tariff fight between the two countries is intensifying.
The Western attempt to quash Green China Inc. is problematic for at least three reasons: It’s environmentally dangerous, geopolitically moot, and, even when viewed purely through the lens of Western self-interest, economically counterproductive. Indeed, the West is in a strong position to profit from the maturation of Green China Inc., largely because of the West’s long-standing leadership in technological innovation.
Green China Inc.’s maturation presents myriad opportunities for Western players. Four stand out: China’s current opening of its electric vehicle market, the world’s largest, to international companies; foreign investment in big Chinese clean-energy projects; a market in China for increasingly sophisticated technologies and business models to combat air pollution; and, amid the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive program of Chinese investment in infrastructure in approximately 65 countries, a desire by many of those countries to balance the money and technology they’re getting from China with money and technology from the West.
It is important to be clear: A transition to a smarter Western approach to Green China Inc. won’t be easy or smooth; it will be hard and rough.
But now is a crucial moment for the West to grasp its economic self-interest and modernize its approach to Green China Inc. It is possible that the trade talks between the United States and China that have faltered as of this writing still may be resuscitated. That would offer a potential framework for a less-antagonistic economic relationship between the two countries. But whatever happens with trade negotiations, an overarching reality remains: China has launched a potentially massive transformation of its green enterprise, one intended to improve the economic efficiency of a Green China Inc. that has, in fundamental ways, grown soft. That is an opportunity for Western capitalists as much as for Chinese ones—to say nothing of the planet.

The government faces a renewable energy trilemma. It has set itself a target of quadrupling the generation capacity of solar energy by 2022 and shifting the production of new automotive vehicles from the internal combustion model to electric vehicles (EV) by 2030. In parallel, it wants the clean energy industry to develop within the framework of its “Make in India” agenda. Finally, it wants to reduce the country’s dependence on energy and energy-related imports.
The trilemma is that it cannot achieve all three of these objectives, as matters stand today. It can, conceivably, meet its solar energy and EV targets but only if it allows the industry to trawl the international market for the cheapest sources of polysilicon, photovoltaic (PV) modules and lithium-ion batteries to ensure competitiveness. PV panels account for 60 per cent of the cost of solar power and lithium-ion batteries 40 per cent of the costs of an EV. Currently, China dominates the market for all three products. On the other hand, it can promote its objectives of “Make in India” and energy self-reliance but only by imposing tariffs, and/or anti-dumping duties, on the imports of these products. The consequential impact will be higher costs and the uncompetitiveness of solar energy generation and EV production. This would deter consumers from shifting to these cleaner alternatives and the government may have to forego its generation targets. In short, the government can at best achieve only two of its three objectives.

Who doesn’t want clean or ‘green’ energy? But what if this costs a bit more? We might quickly find many people’s appetite for renewable energy (RE) is lower, especially if the worry cited is something as invisible, long-term, and global as CO2 emissions that impact climate change. RE is making enormous progress in India—but it is driven more by targets, governmental support, and simple economics than a consumer push for being green. The good news is that the price for RE, especially solar power (photovoltaics, or PV) is falling dramatically. What this can allow us to do is focus on the next set of challenges in making RE scale, sustainably.

Picture taken July 3, 2016. REUTERS/Jason ReedOrigin said the partnership with the fast-growing UK firm and use of its Kraken platform would radically improve Origin’s customer service, cut its costs sharply and give it international growth opportunities.Origin Chief Executive Frank Calabria said the deal was focused on securing the low-cost technology and user-friendly system Octopus has developed.“Our main game is about delivering on that retail strategy and doing it fast and getting ahead of our competitors, which I think we’re putting ourselves in a good position to do,” he told Reuters in an interview.International growth for Origin would not come from making a bid for Octopus but from the UK company’s own expansion.“I’ve not gone in to buy 20% with the objective of taking them out,” Calabria said.The push comes as Origin faces pressure from the Australian government to cut retail tariffs and as it looks to differentiate itself in the transition to cleaner energy, allowing it to offer products tailored to customers adopting rooftop solar power, home batteries and electric cars.“It will have significant benefits for our customers and also our shareholders,” Calabria said.Octopus said the deal, under discussion since 2019, values the company at well over 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) and said it would use the funds from Origin to develop its technology and expand into more markets.“We’re thrilled to be able to accelerate our global expansion to make the green energy transition cheaper and faster,” Octopus Energy founder and chief executive, Greg Jackson, said in a statement.Octopus, among a number of smaller brands challenging Britain’s traditional power suppliers, last month agreed to work with German utility E.ON to revamp its UK retail business and in January acquired French firm Engie’s 70,000 British residential customers.Origin said it would pay Octopus A$134 million up front and A$373 million over four financial years.The transfer of Origin’s electricity and gas customer accounts to the new platform would result in pre-tax savings of around A$75 million in the year to June 2022, rising to around A$125 million annually from 2024.That would come on top of A$100 million in cost savings Origin aims to achieve by June 2021.The platform switch will cost around A$90 million, Origin said.“For our customers, they will have a vastly simpler experience,” Calabria said.Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

402,/article/idUSL1N2CY050,Energy dispute deepens between Mexico and foreign allies,"By Diego Oré, Dave Graham4 Min ReadMEXICO CITY, May 16 (Reuters) - The European Union and Canada have formally raised concerns to Mexico about rules they say endanger renewable energy projects, escalating tensions with its government, which late on Friday moved to tighten its control over the power industry.In letters that were leaked to Mexican media on Friday, the same day they were sent, the foreign powers said the rules threatened foreign investment in the energy sector. Diplomatic sources confirmed the letters were genuine on Saturday.The Mexican government has not commented publicly in response to the letters, but on Saturday the energy ministry wrote in a post on Twitter that “it is the responsibility of the state to guarantee the reliability of the system in an orderly, continuous and effective manner.”The highly unusual diplomatic intervention by Canada and the European powers, some of Mexico’s closest allies, underlines the frustration felt by foreign governments over President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s handling of energy policy.Lopez Obrador has pledged to make Mexico more self-sufficient and strengthen the state’s role in energy.The letters raise concerns about rules issued by electricity regulator CENACE last month that suspended the operation of new renewable energy plants in Mexico, arguing it was necessary to safeguard power supply during the coronavirus outbreak.Late on Friday, Mexico’s energy ministry published additional rules in the government’s official gazette that give the public sector more control over the national electricity system.Foreign governments and international investors are worried Mexico is eroding the legal foundations of contracts worth billions of dollars with the previous administration, in what they see as a creeping squeeze-out of their interests.Canada’s ambassador-designate to Mexico, Graeme Clark, said in the Canadian letter that the new CENACE regulations would imperil Canadian renewable energy projects and requested a meeting with Mexican authorities to discuss the measures.“This agreement joins a host of measures, legal and policy changes that attack investment in renewable energy in the country,” Clark said in the letter addressed to Energy Minister Rocio Nahle.Companies such as ATCO, Canadian Solar, Cubico Sustainable Investments and Northland Power could be affected, the Canadian embassy added.A spokeswoman for the embassy confirmed the authenticity of the letter.In its letter to Nahle, the European Union’s delegation in Mexico said the CENACE rules would “negatively impact” 44 renewable energy projects in Mexico and jeopardize investment from EU companies, which totals more than $6.4 billion.Two diplomatic sources confirmed the authenticity of the EU letter.When asked by Reuters for comment on the letter, the EU’s delegation said whenever the bloc had important issues to discuss with Mexico’s government, it did so in private, and had nothing further to add.

403,/article/idUSKCN24M1DS,Ukraine approves cuts to green energy tariffs,"By Reuters Staff3 Min ReadKYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian parliament adopted on Tuesday a law significantly reducing tariffs for renewable energy, eliminating the problem of mass non-payments in the energy sector, criticised by investors and Western partners.Ukraine set up special tariffs for renewable energy companies several years ago to expand the green power production and pledged to buy all the energy produced.But these high tariffs have become a burden for the state, which faces recession caused by coronavirus epidemic. The government expects the economy to shrink 10% in the second quarter after a 1.3% drop in the first quarter.In June, the government and some companies signed a memorandum on reducing tariffs by 15% for solar generation and by 7.5% for wind generation, and lawmakers say the adopted law will allow the government to implement this document.Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a tweet that the legislation would help reduce prices for solar and wind energy, as well as achieve green goals and protect international investors.The law contains the same level of cuts as the memorandum and if the law is signed by the president, the tariffs will be reduced from July 1 while Ukraine will provide investors with guarantees that the adopted legislations will not change in the future.“This law is to provide the government with the necessary tools to implement the memorandum and we hope to end this issue on the crisis of non-payments in green energy,” said David Arakhamia, the leader of the pro-presidential majority in parliament.The state’s debt to green energy companies for electricity supplied since the beginning of the year amounted to 14 billion hryvnia ($526 million) as of early June, the energy ministry said.Investors say energy producers have not been paid in full since March, where the average level of payment has been 5% to 10% of its obligations.In a joint statement, published by the American Chamber of Commerce, they urged Ukraine “to ensure that any amendments shall in no way result in negative consequences for renewable investors.”“This is a prerequisite to avoid numerous arbitrations and for international financial institutions to provide financing to stabilize the market situation in energy sector,” they said.Reporting by Pavel Polityuk, editing by Louise Heavens and Chizu NomiyamaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File PhotoA cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was aimed at ending what former British Prime Minister Theresa May called “rip-off” prices by energy firms.The reduction, to the lowest level since the cap began, was due to a fall in wholesale gas prices since February as lockdowns on business and homes hit demand, Ofgem said.“The COVID-19 crisis has depressed energy demand although wholesale gas prices have started to recover since hitting 20-year lows in the spring,” the regulator said in a statement.The cap for average annual consumption on the most common tariffs, used by around 11 million households, will fall by 84 pounds ($110) to 1,042 pounds, while for some 4 million homes on pre-payment energy meters it will fall by 95 pounds to 1,070 pounds a year, Ofgem added on Friday.Ofgem calculates the cap using a formula that includes wholesale gas prices, energy suppliers network costs and costs of government policies, such as renewable power subsidies.Graphic - Breakdown of a British dual fuel (gas and electricity) bill% :However, Ofgem warned that with wholesale prices beginning to rise the cap is likely to be increased at the next review, which comes into affect in April.Under legislation the cap could be lifted from 2020 and no later than 2023.Ofgem on Friday recommended it should remain in place next year, with an ultimate decision to be taken by the government by the end of October.“Our assessments shows this is not the right time to remove the cap,” Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s chief executive, told reporters on a call.He said the regulator would like to see a more competitive market, better customer engagement and more technology such as smart meters deployed before the cap is removed.Despite the cap, Ofgem said those seeking cheaper energy prices may still find better deals by shopping around.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Breakdown of a British dual fuel (gas and electricity) bill % tmsnrt.rs/2Ptx1os^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>Reporting by Susanna Twidale; Editing by Edmund Blair, Jason Neely and Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
