joins david dollar episode discuss chinas economic growth model potential reforms economy responded trade war covid related content china bubble never pops covid recession good time accelerate chinese reform transcript lightly edited clarity tom orlik chief economist bloomberg economics twitter tomorlik david dollar senior fellow foreign policy global economy development john l thornton china center twitter davidrdollar dollar hi im david dollar host brookings trade podcast dollars sense today guest tom orlik chief economist bloomberg economics author new book china bubble never pops welcome show tom orlik great here david thanks on dollar so lived beijing long time think  years remember correctly youve seen best worst china lets start positive things saw help us understand china successful dynamic orlik so think one prevailing narratives china hear west singleparty state large presence state economy policy space market space kind sclerotic right theres kind nationwide suppression incentives perform something like saw soviet union s s think thats sort important underpinning china collapse pessimism china collapse theories implicitly inform us views china certainly true political system state ownership economy depressing impact overwhelming impression meeting chinese policymakers chinese workers chinese entrepreneurs sense dynamism forwardlooking optimism ingenuity so think central bank peoples bank china think one things strikes peoples bank china last fifteen years much policy innovation there reform interest rate system reform exchange rate system steps theyve taken begin derisking financial system strikes kind energetic ingenious institution clearly theres huge number problems china clearly huge number problems social system focus narrowly economics impression came away discussions policymakers discussions ground sense people motivated incentive think outside box dollar thats really nice point tom policy space experience china well really lot room debate certain topics lot issues take financial sector debt growth model know things actively debated topics completely taboo im certainly defending chinese authoritarianism nice point lot freedom freedom may generous word lot space policy debate lets turn book key point china relied lot buildup debt rapid growth credit order fuel growth so would summarize basic story book need rapid credit growth whos borrowing whos lending orlik original sin chinas economy chinas unbalanced growth model extremely high savings rate china saves very high proportion national income turn saving demand theres two possibilities lend overseas comes back chinese economy form export demand thats successfully s even entered world trade organization  or lend themselves comes back form investment great financial crisis exporting wasnt really working anymore model switched turning saving exports turning saving investment  on astonishingly rapid buildup debt financial system  extending borrowing  gdp time get  gone way  gdp look around world cant actually find economies taken much debt short period time find bunch economies like korea  us ahead lehman shock  greece countries ahead european sovereign debt crisis took lot debt much debt china lot debt financial crisis concern people looking china is youve borrowed much borrowed much short period time surely youre going bunch bad loans surely banks going fall over dollar given buildup debt obviously theres risk financial crisis thats key point book dont see likely scenario come back certainly possibility might precipitating events theres coronavirus trade war us something havent thought yet possible precipitating events financial crisis orlik thats great question think financial crisis need two conditions met financial crisis need bunch bad loans need funding banks dry up think lehman shock example things happened right lehman bunch investments mortgagebacked securities turned much riskier lehman realized investors funding lehmans operations realized lehman risky positions pulled away funding lehman collapsed need things place need bad loans also need funding banks disappear kind useful framework thinking could trigger crisis china already one conditions right theres already lot bad loans china look balance sheets city banks see large buildup sort shadowy investments probably money already lent borrowers cant service loans theres lot bad loans there problems like covid shock problems like renewed trade war us thats get would make worse right problems like that hammer incomes borrowers make harder service debt mean likely bad loans condition financial crisis disappearance funding drying funding banks thats condition met china one big arguments book savings rate high still difficult take money country banks solid funding base thats why even see hidden bad loans increase dont see chinas banks falling over dollar right basically agree there tom one thing worry key part china pretty effective capital controls theres real limitations much people take country seemed work pretty well assume whether capital controls work depends lot state world chinese people really lose confidence system probably lot ways around capital controls havent discovered yet dont see happening moment thats fundamental issue know people losing faith chinese system orlik yeah think youre completely right beijing  moment collapse chinese equity market botched devaluation yuan peoples bank china triggered sort panicked moment hundreds billions dollars left china quickly moment where think genuine sense panic genuine fear perhaps risks could crystallize because course enormous capital outflows funding banks disappearing moment financial crisis could happen beijing moment quietly tighten screws remember going bank period try transfer earnings dollars move country paper trailno one said no paper trail required kind mile long one point bank said employment contract long enough so ultimately chinese people lose faith chinese economy see mass capital flight something chinese government going able easily control especially trade account big theres many ways hiding capital flows trade account saw  actually quite good tightening screws want to dollar bubble china pop theres financial crisis sketch might look like affects china would affect us rest world orlik shock china shock ripples hits rest world happens china well starts default single borrower banks recalculate risks associated lending similar borrowers start pulling back lending start refusing roll loans defaults spread starts kind single default spreads systemic crisis businesses rely credit course businesses dont enough cash flow keep solvent start going bankrupt start letting go workers demand disappears kind selffeeding shock similar saw united states lehman shock  chinas growth lets say covid shock goes back  percent year craters period contraction chinas economy now us financial system blew  financial linkages spilled around world caused problems european banks japanese banks latin american banks then course collapse us demand second round effect countries financial shock real economy shock demand imports us disappeared china know david financial linkages rest world well developed arent lot businesses around world lot banks around world close important connections chinese banks chinas financial system implodes dont actually see immediate financial ripple effect would see kind riskoff mood riskoff moment global financial markets youd expect see equity markets us europe japan collapse potentially significant negative confidence effects would hit economies immediately bigger one see real economy impact chinas significant driver demand exports especially commodity producers like australia brazil chile suffer substantially china also substantial driver demand countries asia region chinese tourists disappear chinese consumer demand falls countries region like thailand example see grade fall sharply asian countries also extremely integrated chinese electronics supply chain see financial crisis hits chinese manufacturing sector see big electronics producers east coast go bankrupt also negative impact japan korea philippines countries feed electronics supply chain europe us well actually impact bit less countervailing positives impact bit less countries much away and export china much commodity producer asian neighbor countries commodity importers so china collapses price oil example collapses thats actually good news european countries means import bill falls related content order chaos covid recession good time accelerate chinese reform david dollar yiping huang yang yao tuesday july   dollar lets talk little bit response coronavirus natural response seeing around world big keynesian stimulus fiscal policy monetary numbers japan united states overwhelming much  percent gdp case japan find interesting china actually seems rather modest terms stimulus rolling out china lacks transparency this best estimate providing fiscal monetary stimulus far less united states japan mean technocrats top leaders behind them getting serious controlling leverage response kind worries raised book orlik think thats really interesting question david think theres things going on first thing really overdid  famous fourtrillion yuan stimulus premier wen launched effective offsetting impact great financial crisis stimulus went long left china legacy huge amount debt dont space run another big stimulus think second thing china instruments countries have state sector china big inefficient big source corruption thats probably net negative china also instrument government use act kind countercyclical buffer private sector isnt hiring private sector isnt investing government instruct state sector keep hold employees accelerate investment projects think maybe hinting point transparency fiscal stimulus kind quasifiscal stimulus doesnt show ministry finances books similar type impact economy dollar ultimately youre cautiously optimistic would say dont see financial crisis likely scenario highlight serious risks important things china continue healthy growth without financial crisis youve touched them would add terms policy agenda china orlik continue growing china needs engineer set mutually reinforcing reforms need restore link credit growth growth real economy grow without massively adding existing levels debt leverage need continue transition manufacturing services need smaller efficient state sector leaving room dynamic private sector thats one area theyre certainly making progress indeed going wrong direction last years need larger role consumption smaller role investment need environmentally sustainable growth model sounds like lot lot fact transitions mutually reinforcing right service sector capitallight industrial sector service sector carbonlight industrial sector service sector labor intensive industrial sector so transition industry services dont need much credit relationship credit growth rate economy gets better dont burn much carbon economy becomes environmentally sustainable employ people labor demand goes up wages rise quickly hopefully get stronger consumption theres huge amount do respects chinas moving wrong direction especially relationship state private sector many transitions interlinked mutually reinforcing think thats sort basis cautious optimism dollar see common thread running lot recommendations need open create competitive markets different areas natural response coronavirus might close things off seeing around world think quite unfortunate takes quite bit leadership even courage go direction mean positive note probably noticed china reached agreement asean japan south korea rcep trade agreement modest still positive step right direction force china open markets little bit more orlik years ago decided could absorb certain number acronyms rcep trade agreement didnt make cut so didnt track developments there certainly sounds like sounds like positive one dollar right regional comprehensive economic program long time economists kind poohpoohed nearly deep integration transpacific partnership pretty serious trade liberalization curiously enough positive effects sense quantitatively negative effects us trade war could say china undoing trade war participating asia pacificwide trade liberalization fact brings nicely last topic want take up tom directly relevant book obviously everyones mind uschina relations related sense hostility trade

possible president trump win happens would anticipate wed something looks like continuity uschina relations biden wins well find out trump identified new trajectory uschina relations going trajectory going forwards moment actually going go back constructive engagement suspect actually former think fear chinas rise something unique president trump think fairly widespread among us voters indeed

reduce scarring—a lot happen anyway even banks dont continue lend think conserving bank capital building capital key want make two points one regime built around dynamic resilience uk ive part member financial policy committee also think us capital regime moving wrong direction stress event capital requirements stress test fallen framework becoming less countercyclical ill explain think that

part looking michael blank samuel hanson jeremy stein adi sunderam working paper global financial crisis could see buildup capital crisis make banks resilient would much larger one two percentage points questioned whether started one could gotten ccyb three half five staff estimated would needed might trouble even starting two say   least would better chance getting needed make banking system resilient going one two steady state would add little bit tier one capital requirements—about quarter percentage point wasnt big increase little increase quantity quality capital stress test helps financial policy committee decide ccyb be us make test countercyclical lower unemployment rate is bigger increase unemployment rate higher property prices greater fall property prices are also look stress environment financial environment risk environment globally past couple years stress test produced larger drawdowns uk capital importantly perception rising global risk including leverage us businesses leverages china also believe releasing ccyb effective macroprudential tool enable encourage banks lend stresses materialize think important point adds amount capital drawn banks get spot capital stack might required cut back dividends share buybacks bonuses paid top management so gives bit cushion banks willing use so released ccyb twice market volatility follow brexit referendum june  couple months ago covid stress think important point is started standard risk environment buffer way one  way two  wasnt financial system caused stress came somewhere else releasing buffer gave banks way lending banks wouldnt amplifying stress respect dividend issue  said banks could use released capital increase dividends course  bank england strong support financial policy committee convinced banks shouldnt pay dividends conserve capital cut way back cash bonuses management building buffers top basic requirements gets capital high enough stress event survivethe taxpayers required step in addition emphasized buffers usable including capital conservation buffer buffers serve two purposes building buffers top basic requirements gets capital high enough stress event survive especially important systemically important institutions taxpayers required step in second point one ive emphasizing buffers give capital drawn stress keep lending flowing prevent banks amplifying already bad event think middle test second rationale banks actually lend using buffers management buffers built up extra theyve gotten ccyb markets view declines capital liquidity metrics banks willing test markets might view that weve already restricted dividends buybacks uk threat getting distribution restriction territory much less still clear banks going deal this hope encourage recognize externality lending everyones collective interest continue loan use capital theyve built makes economy stronger turn reduce losses us contrast uk going wrong direction capital structure us stress test said marginal capital constraint many large banks updating paper nellie liang wrote showed  stress capital buffer capital buffer fell stress test fell fell substantially result occurred situation

webinar showed very clearly starting point capital stress critical increases weve capital liquidity regulatory reforms  meant banks able play constructive role  concerning  stress test implied authorities okay starting point declining particularly time banks already talking drawing management buffers downward pressure starting place changes stress test regime weakened countercyclical aspects stress test much countercyclicality stress test came requirement banks stress prefund eight quarters dividends share repurchases naturally planned dividends share repurchase rise good times fall bad times so prefunding requirement gave bit higher capital stress requirement good times scaled back bad times prefunding requirement scaled back four quarters dividends eight nine quarters dividends share buybacks thats much less countercyclical capital requirement stress tests second point thats changed stress test fed used impose soft limit  percent dividends proportion distributions theyve eliminated limit allowed dividends rise relative share buybacks seen graphically illustrated current environment much easier cut share repurchases cut dividends encouraging allowing dividends rise relative share repurchases goes countercyclicality macroprudential requirement finally test assumes constant balance sheet rather small increase assumed bank lending risk related assets think important banks able fund capitalize increases lending even stress environment now requirement reduced fed us authorities use current experience toreevaluate public interest costs benefits way moving stress tests so recommendation fed us authorities use current experience think hard reevaluate public interest costs benefits way moving stress tests effect likely making bank capital rather less countercyclical moreover think us adopt framework dynamic resilience positive countercyclical buffer standard risk environments weve seen stresses dont always originate financial sector so waiting financial sector gives signal raising countercyclical buffer late things happen mean public interest served releasing buffer dynamic resilience jeremy others talking about release capital buffer

first see greater shares minority students schools vacancies and presumably shortages acute also find progressively minority teachers schools well schools many hardtofill vacancies showed larger discrepancies student teacher representation in terms differences percentage points differences proportional representation challenges schools hence schools facing shortages—at least national perspective—do show systematic pattern minority underrepresentation further schools many hardtofill vacancies highest teacher minority shares analysis hiring minority teachers specifically schools
